Andersen"> <div><h2>The Triumph of Hope</h2> <strong>Elder Neil L. Andersen</strong> <br><small>Quorum of the Twelve Apostles</small></div></div>        <div class="d-flex gap-3"><div><p>The eyes of Heaven will certainly be focused upon us. We will hear the voice of the Lord through his servants. We will feel the guiding directing and comforting influence of the Holy Ghost and our faith will be strengthened. Three years ago, president Russell M Nelson began general conference with these words. Pure Revelation for the questions in your heart will make this conference rewarding and Unforgettable. If you have not yet sought for the ministering of the Holy Ghost to help you to hear what the Lord would have you here during these two days. I invite you to do so now.</p><p>Please. Make this conference. A time of feasting on messages from the Lord through his servants. The scriptures link three words powerfully together. Okay. Charity. The gift of Hope is a Priceless endowment from God. The word hope is used in many things. We want to happen. For example, I hope it won't rain Or I hope our team wins. My intent. Is to speak of our sacred and eternal hopes. Centered in Jesus Christ and the restored gospel. And our confident expectations of the promised blessings of righteousness. Our Hope of eternal life is assured through the grace of Christ and our own choices. Allowing us the remarkable blessing of returning to our Heavenly home.</p><p>And living forever in peace and happiness. With our heavenly father, his beloved Son, our faithful family and precious friends. And the righteous men and women from every continent and every century. On Earth, we experience joy and sorrow as we are tested and proven. Our Victory comes through faith in Jesus Christ. As we triumphed over our sins, difficulties Temptations, unfairness, and the challenges of this Mortal life. We are strengthened. Our as we strengthen our faith. In Jesus Christ, we see beyond our struggles to the blessings and Promises of Eternity. Like a light whose Brilliance grows. Hope brightens, the darkened world and we see our glorious future.</p><p>Since the beginning, our heavenly father and his beloved Son. Have eagerly blessed the righteous with the precious gift of Hope.</p><p>The power of the Lord's spirit enlightens, the faithful today, Illuminating the reality of eternal life. The Savior sends us a comforter the Holy Ghost. A companion, bringing Faith, hope, and peace. Not as the world given. In the world, the Savior said. You shall have tribulation but be of good cheer. Keep a brightness of Hope I have overcome the world. In times of difficulty, we choose to trust the Lord in faith. We quietly, pray. Not by will, but thine be done. We feel the Lord's approval for our Meek willingness And we await the promise, peace, the Lord will send in his chosen timing.</p><p>The Apostle Paul taught. The god of. Will fill you with joy and peace. That you may abound in Hope. Rejoicing in Hope patient. In Tribulation, through the power of the Holy Ghost. The prophet Moroni knew firsthand about having hope in Christ during tribulation, He explained his harrowing situation. I am alone. I have not whether to go I make not myself know unless they should destroy me. Remarkably. In this dark and lonely hour. Moroni records. His father's words of Hope. If a man have faith, He must needs have hope. What is it that ye shall hope for?</p><p>Ye shall have hope through the atonement of Christ and the power of his resurrection to be raised unto life eternal. My brothers and sisters. Hope is a living gift. A gift that grows as we increase our faith in Jesus Christ. Faith is the substance of things hoped for We build this substance the evidence blocks of our faith through prayer Temple or covenants, keeping the Commandments continually feasting on the scriptures and the words of modern day prophets. Taking the sacrament serving others. And worshiping weekly with our fellow Saints. To fortify Our Hope in a time of increasing wickedness.</p><p>The Lord has directed his Prophet who died the Earth with his temples. As we enter the Lord's house. We feel the spirit of God, verifying Our The temple, testifies of the empty tomb, and that life beyond the veil continues for all For those who do not have an eternal companion. The ordinances powerfully confirm that every righteous person will receive every promised blessing. There is Sublime. As a young couple kneels across the altar to be sealed, not just for time, but for eternity, There is an immensity of Hope for us in the promises made to our posterity whatever their current circumstances.</p><p>There is no pain, no sickness, no Injustice, no suffering, nothing that can darken. Our Hope as we believe and hold tightly to our covenants with God in the house of the Lord. It is a house of light. A House of Hope.</p><p>We share tears of Sorrow as we see the sadness and despair in those who have no hope in Christ. I recently observed from a distance. A couple who at one time had faith in Christ, but they decided to discard their belief. They were successful in the world and they found pleasure in their intellect and a rejection of their faith. All seemed well until the husband still young and energetic. Suddenly fell ill and died. Like an eclipse of the sun, they had blocked the light of the sun. And the result was an eclipse of Hope. The wife in her. Disbelief now felt disoriented painfully unprepared unable to comfort her children.</p><p>Her intellect had told her that her life was in perfect order until suddenly she could see no tomorrow. Her despair. Brought darkness and confusion. Let me contrast her painful despair. With another family's hope in Christ, during a heartbreaking time. 21 years ago, the newborn son of my nephew Ben Anderson and his wife Robbie Was life-flighted from their Idaho farming Community, to Salt Lake City. I arrived at the hospital and Ben explained, the severe life-threatening complications with their baby's heart. We placed our hands on Trey's tiny head. The Lord blessed him, which continued life. Trey had heart surgery, the first week of his life and more surgeries followed.</p><p>As the years passed, it became apparent that Trey would need a heart transplant. Although his physical activities were limited, his faith expanded, he wrote, I have never felt sorry for myself because I have always known the importance of having faith in Jesus Christ. And a testimony of the Plan of Salvation. Trey kept on his phone. This well-known quote from president Nelson. The joy. We feel has little to do with the circumstances of Our Lives. And everything to do with the focus of Our Lives. Trey wrote. I've always looked forward to serving a full-time Mission. But my doctor,</p><p>Trey was excited of being accepted into the accounting major at BYU beginning this semester But even more excited in Late July, when he received a very anticipated telephone call, To come to the hospital for his heart transplant. One year Trey said, And I will be on my mission.</p><p>There were great expectations as he entered the operating room. However, During the surgery. There were devastating complications. And Trey never regained Consciousness. His mother, Robbie said, Friday had been the most heartbreaking day just trying to wrap our minds around it. I had stayed up late, just trying to process everything. But Saturday, I woke up with a feeling of absolute Joy. It wasn't just peace, it wasn't denial. I felt joy for my sons. And I felt Joy as his mother. Dan had gotten up a lot earlier than me and when we finally got a chance to talk.</p><p>Then had awakened with the exact same feeling. Bear explained. Clarity came to my soul as God taught me through his holy spirit. I awoke at 4 am and was filled with Indescribable peace and joy. How is this possible? The passing of Trey is so very painful and I miss him so much. But the Lord does not leave us comfortless. I look forward to a joyful reunion.</p><p>They had noted in his journal. These words from president Nelson's General Conference talk. It doesn't seem possible to feel Joy when your child suffers with an incurable illness or when you lose your job or when your spouse betrays you yet, that is precisely the joy. The Savior offers His Joy is constant assuring us that our Affliction shall be, but a small moment and be consecrated to our King. Brothers and sisters. The peace, you seek may not come as quickly as you desire. But I promise you that as you trust in the Lord, His peace will come.</p><p>May we nurture, our precious Faith pressing forward with a perfect brightness of I testified that our hope is our Savior Jesus Christ. He is the god of Hope, the Triumph of Pope. He lives. And he loves you. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p></div> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-svelte-h="svelte-tyn8xv"><i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i></button></div></div> </div></div> </div></div> </div><div class="accordion" id="8hjr9zmx67nsigb1xkhe-1"><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapse-8hjr9zmx67nsigb1xkhe-1" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapse-8hjr9zmx67nsigb1xkhe-1"><span>President Emily Belle Freeman <br> <small>Live Up to Your Privileges</small></span> </button></h2> <div id="flush-collapse-8hjr9zmx67nsigb1xkhe-1" class="accordion-collapse multi-collapse-8hjr9zmx67nsigb1xkhe collapse" data-bs-parent="#8hjr9zmx67nsigb1xkhe-1"><div class="accordion-body"><div class="d-flex flex-column gap-3"><div class="d-flex flex-row justify-content-start align-items-end gap-3"><img class="speaker-image svelte-1l0ikvw" src="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/ec557c756d0a11eea481eeeeac1eed073bec2a83/full/!320%2C400/0/default" alt="Speaker Image President Emily Belle Freeman"> <div><h2>Live Up to Your Privileges</h2> <strong>President Emily Belle Freeman</strong> <br><small>Young Women General President</small></div></div>        <div class="d-flex gap-3"><div><p>Recently my husband, Greg received a diagnosis that would require an intensive surgery and months of chemotherapy. Like many of you who have faced a similar situation. We immediately began praying for Heaven's help, and God's power. The Sunday following Greg's surgery, the sacrament was delivered to our hospital room on this occasion. I was the only one taking the sacrament one piece of bread. One cup of water. At church, my mind often focuses on the delivery system of the sacrament, the preparing, the blessing, and the passing. But on that afternoon, I pondered the gift of God's power available to me, through the sacred ordinance itself. And the Covenant promise I was making as I took that piece of bread and that cup of water.</p><p>This was a time when I needed power from. In the midst of great heartache, exhaustion and uncertainty. I wondered about this gift that would allow me to draw upon the power from him. That I so desperately needed partaking of the sacrament would increase my companionship with the spirit of the Lord allowing me to draw upon the gift of God's power, including the ministering of angels and the saviors enabling strength to overcome Think I had ever realized with this much Clarity before that? It's not only who officiates in the ordinance that matters. What the ordinance and our covenant promise unlocks also deserves the focus of our attention.</p><p>Priesthood ordinances and Covenant promises. Allow God to sanctify us and then work wonders in our lives.</p><p>But how does this happen? First, in order for an ordinance to manifest, the power of God in our lives, it must be done with authority from the son of God. The delivery system is important, the father entrusted, Jesus Christ with the keys and authority to oversee, the delivery of his priesthood ordinances under his Direction within the order of his priesthood. The sons of God have been ordained Stand in place of the son of God. Second. We don't just make covenant promises. We must keep them in many gospel ordinances. We make sacred covenants with God. He promises to bless us as we keep those covenants. Do we realize it is the combination of priesthood ordinances along with the keeping of Covenant promises, that allows us to draw upon God's power.</p><p>That afternoon, I wondered if I a covenant daughter of God fully understood how to access the gift of God's power through priesthood ordinances. And if I truly recognized, how God's power Works within me in 2019, a prophetic invitation was extended to the women of the church teaching us how to draw the savior's power into our lives. President. Russell M, Nelson invited And it's 25 a revelation given to Emma Smith in harmony Pennsylvania. Accepting that invitation changed my life. Last month, I had an unexpected opportunity to visit Harmony there under the maple trees. The priesthood was restored to Joseph Smith and Oliver cowdery.</p><p>Close to those trees is the front door of Joseph and Emma's home. Across from the fireplace in that home, there is a window. I stood at that window and wondered what Emma might have thought, as she looked out across the trees in July of 1830. Emma was 26 years old. She was so young. She was three and a half years into her marriage. She has lost a baby boy her first. His little grave is just down the lane, from her home. Standing at that window. It was not hard for me to imagine what might have filled her thoughts.</p><p>Surely she worried about their finances about the increasing persecution that threatened their safety about their future. And yet the work of God was everywhere around her. Did she also wonder about her place in the plan? Her purpose in his kingdom, and her potential in the eyes of God. I think she may have. Just across the way, the gift of God's priesthood, Authority and keys have been restored to the Earth This was a time when Emma actually needed power from Heaven in the midst of great heartache, exhaustion and uncertainty. I imagine Emma wondered about this gift of God's priesthood that could unlock the power from him, that she so desperately needed. But Emma didn't just stand at that window and wonder.</p><p>The Prophet Joseph was being tutored in Keys offices. Ordinances, and how to assist in the service of the priesthood. The Lord himself through his Prophet, gave a revelation to Emma, not Naboo, released Society. President Emma, this Revelation was given to 26-year-old. Emma in harmony through Revelation, Emma would learn about the inward, sanctification and Covenant connection, that would increase the ability of those priesthood ordinances to.</p><p>First, the Lord reminded Emma of her place in his plan, including who she was, and whose she was a daughter in his kingdom. She was invited to walk. The paths of virtue a path that included ordinances that would unlock God's power. If Emma held onto her covenants. Second in her season of deep mourning, the lord gave her purpose. Emma didn't just have a front row.</p><p>The work taking place, she would be set apart to expound scriptures and to exhort the church. Her time would be given to writing and to learning much Emma was given a sacred role to help prepare the Saints to worship their songs unto the Lord would be received as prayers and answered with a blessing upon their hands. Last the Lord outlined the process of inward sanctification that would prepare Emma for exaltation. Except I'll do this. The Lord explained to her. Where I am. You cannot come. If we read section 25 carefully, we discover an important progression taking place. Emma would go from being a daughter in the Kingdom to elect lady to Queen aaronic and Melchizedek priesthood ordinances combined with the keeping of her Covenant promises would increase her companionship with the spirit, and with angels, empowering her to navigate her life with Divine guidance, through his divine power, God.</p><p>Heal her heart. Enlarge her capacity and transform her into the version of herself. He knew she could become and through the ordinances of the Melchizedek priesthood. The power of godliness would be manifest in her life and the Lord would part the veil. So she could receive understanding from him. This is what it looks like to work for God's power to work within us. President Russell M, Nelson, taught. Everything that happened in harmony has profound implications for your life. The restoration of the priesthood along with the Lord's counsel to Emma can guide and bless each of you.</p><p>Accessing the power of God in your life requires the same things that the Lord instructed, Emma, and each of us to do. There were important things happening on both sides of that window in harmony, including the Revelation, given to the elect lady whom the Lord, had called a revelation that would strengthen encourage and instruct Emma Smith, God's daughter, When our granddaughter Isabel was given a name and a blessing, her father blessed her, with an understanding of the priesthood that she would continue to grow in and learn about the blessing. It would provide in her life and that her faith in the priesthood would grow as she continued to grow in understanding.</p><p>It is not often a little girl is blessed to understand the priesthood and to learn how those priesthood ordinances and Covenant promises will help her to access God's power but I remembered Emma and thought to myself. Why not this tiny daughter has the potential to become an elect lady in his kingdom and eventually a queen through his priesthood ordinances and the keeping of her Covenant promises, God's power will work in and through through Overcome whatever life brings and become the woman. God knows she can become. This is something I want each girl in the Kingdom to understand.</p><p>Live up to your privileges. Learn how priesthood ordinances and Covenant promises will allow God's power to flow into your life, with greater efficacy working in and through you, empowering and equipping you to reach your full potential. Carefully study and Ponder, the aaronic and the Melchizedek priesthood ordinances. The Covenant promises we make with each and the power of God we access through those ordinances. Remember it's not only who officiates in the ordinance that matters what the ordinance and your Covenant promise unlocks. Also deserves the focus of your attention, partaking of the bread and water is a weekly reminder of his power.</p><p>You overcome. Wearing the Garment of the Holy priesthood is a daily, reminder of the gift of his power working in you to help you become We all have access to the gift of God's power. Every time we partake at the sacrament, every time we cross the threshold of a temple, this is the highlight of my Sabbath. This is why I cherish my temple recommend in the ordinances there. The power of godliness is.</p><p>Of this gift. I bear witness in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p></div> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-svelte-h="svelte-tyn8xv"><i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i></button></div></div> </div></div> </div></div> </div><div class="accordion" id="8hjr9zmx67nsigb1xkhe-2"><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapse-8hjr9zmx67nsigb1xkhe-2" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapse-8hjr9zmx67nsigb1xkhe-2"><span>Elder Karl D.

Hirst</strong> <br><small>General Authority Seventy</small></div></div>        <div class="d-flex gap-3"><div><p>I should tell you that two of my children have passed out while speaking, their cold hits and I've never felt more connected to the in this moment. I've got more on my mind than just the trapdoor. Our family has six children who sometimes tease one another, that they're the favorite child. Each has different reasons for being preferred. I'll look for each of our children is pure and fulfilling and complete, we could not love any one of them any more than another With each child's birth came the most beautiful expansion of our love. I most relate to my heavenly father's life for me through the love that I feel for my children.</p><p>As they each rehearse, their claims, to be the possible child. You might have thought that our family had never had an entire bedroom. The sense of blemishes in the relationship between parent and child is diminished with a focus on love. At some point perhaps, because I can see that we're heading towards an inevitable family Riot, I'll say something like, okay, you want me down, but I'm not going to announce it, you know, which one of you is my favorite? My goal is that each one of the six feels Victorious. And all our war is avoided, at least until next time.</p><p>In his gospel, John describes himself as the disciple whom Jesus loved as if that Arrangement was somehow unique. I like to think that this was, because John felt so completely loved by Jesus. Nephi gave me a similar sense when he wrote I glory in my Jesus, As opposed to Saviors and Nephi's anymore, that he's John's and yet the personal nature of Nephi's relationship with his, Jesus led him to that tender description. Isn't it wonderful that there are times when we can feel so fully and personally noticed and loved? Nephi can call him his Jesus. And so, can we.</p><p>Our Savior's love is the highest, noblest, strongest kind of love and he provides until we are filled. Define what never going to die. And we are each a cherished favorite. God's love is where a circle's on a Venn diagram, we all overlap which whichever parts of us seem different. His love is where we find togetherness. Is it any surprise that the greatest Commandments are to love God and to love those around us? When I see people showing christ-like love for one another, it feels to me as if that look contains more than just a download.</p><p>Enough that also has Divinity in it. When we love one another, in this way, completely exposedly and have to get people too. So, it's not what we care about seems distant from a sense of divine love, we can follow this pattern by doing things that bring us closer to God ourselves. And then doing things that bring us closer to them. Unspoken Bethany to come to Christ. I wish I could sit down with you and ask you what? Circumstances caused you to feel God's love? Which verses a scripture, which particular act of service? Where would you be what music in whose company?</p><p>General confidence is a rich place to learn about connecting with Heaven's love. But perhaps you feel a long way from a little girl. Maybe there is a chorus voices, and discouragement and darkness that wait until you falls. Messages telling you that they've got two won't get confused to weak and overlooked to different or disoriented to wine having them in any real way. If you give those ideas, then please hear this. We can confidently disregard Brokenness in any way disqualifying us from having love. Every time we sing to him, that reminds us that our beloved and Flawless Savior chose to be bruised, broken and torn for us.</p><p>Every time we take broken bread, surely Jesus removes all shame from the broken. Through his broadcast, he became perfect. And he can make those perfect, in spite of our Brokenness. Broken, lonely tall and bruised. He was And we may feel we are. But separated from the love of God. We are not broken people. Perfect, love of the song goes. You might know something secret about yourself that makes you feel unlovable. However, right. He might be about what you know about yourself. You'll long to think that you've put yourself beyond the reach of God's love. Sometimes cruel and impatient towards ourselves in ways that we could never imagine being towards anyone else. There is much for us to do in this life but stealth loving and shameful self-condemnation are not on that list.</p><p>Powerfulness shape and we might feel who we are. His arms are not short and no. They are always long enough to reach our reaching and embrace each one of us. When we don't feel the warmth of divine love, it hasn't gone away God's own words are that the mountains shall depart and the hills be removed, but his kindness shall not depart from us. So, just to be clear, the idea that God has stopped loving should be so far down in the list of possible explanations in life and we don't get to it. Until after the mountains have left and the hills are gone.</p><p>Really enjoy this symbol. As a good mountains. Being Everest of the certainty of God's love. That powerful symbol this weaves into accounts with those who go to the mountains to receive Revelation and Isaiah's description of the Mountain of the Lord's house, being established in the top of the mountains. The house of the Lord is the whole of our most precious, Covenant, and a place for us all to retreat and seek deeply into the evidence of our fellow believers. Also enjoyed the comfort that comes to my soul. When I wrap myself more tightly in my baptismal, Covenant, and find someone who's mourning or loss, or breathing a disappointment and I try to help them hold in the process, their feelings.</p><p>These ways that we can become more immersed in the precious covenantal love of Jesus. So it goes look. Doesn't believe us. Why don't we always feel it? Well, just to manage our expectations, I don't know. But being moved is definitely not the same as feeling loved and I have a few thoughts that might help you as you pursue your answer to that question. Perhaps your wrestle with grief, depression, betrayal. Loneliness. Disappointment, all of these can powerfully intrude into your ability to feel God's love for you. If so these things can dull or suspend our ability to feel as we might otherwise feel for a season. At least perhaps you will not be able to feel this love and knowledge will have to suffice.</p><p>But I wonder if you could experiment patiently with different ways of expressing and receiving Divine love, Can you take a step back from whatever is in front of you? And maybe another step and another until you see a wider landscape wider, and wider still. If necessary until you are literally thinking, Celestial. Because you're looking at the stars And remembering worlds without number and through them, their creator. Birdsong feeling the Sun or a breeze or rain on my skin and times when nature puts my senses in all of God. Each has had a card in providing me with a heavenly connection.</p><p>Absolute comfort of faithful friends will help maybe music or service. Have you kept a Journal of times where no connection with God was Clarity. Perhaps you could invite those you trust to share their sources of divine connection with you, as you search for Relief and understanding. I wonder if Jesus were to choose a place where you and he could meet, a private place where you'd be able to have a singular focus on him. Might he choose your unique place of personal suffering? The place where we just meet when no one else can go.</p><p>So may you feel so lonely that you must truly be all alone. But you aren't quite. A place to which perhaps only he has traveled, that actually he has already prepared to meet you there when you arrive, If you're waiting for him to come, he might already be there and within reach. If you do feel filled with love in this season of your life, please try and hold on to it as effectively as a sieve holds water, splash it everywhere you go, one of the Miracles of the Divine economy is that when we try to share Jesus' love, we find ourselves being filled up in a variation of the principle, that whosoever will lose his life for my sake, shall find it.</p><p>Filled with God's love Shields Us in life's storms but also makes the happy moments happier. Our joyful days, when there is sunshine in the sky, are made even brighter by the sunshine in our souls. They become rooted and grounded in our Jesus and his love. Let's look for and Treasure experiences of being filled with divine love, of feeling his individual power in our lives. The joy of the gospel is available to all, not just the happy, not just the downcast. Joy is our purpose, not the gift of our circumstances. We have every good reason to Rejoice and be filled with love toward God, and all men. Let's get full in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p></div> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-svelte-h="svelte-tyn8xv"><i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i></button></div></div> </div></div> </div></div> </div><div class="accordion" id="8hjr9zmx67nsigb1xkhe-3"><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapse-8hjr9zmx67nsigb1xkhe-3" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapse-8hjr9zmx67nsigb1xkhe-3"><span>Elder Dale G Renlund <br> <small>This is My Gospel - This is My Church</small></span> </button></h2> <div id="flush-collapse-8hjr9zmx67nsigb1xkhe-3" class="accordion-collapse multi-collapse-8hjr9zmx67nsigb1xkhe collapse" data-bs-parent="#8hjr9zmx67nsigb1xkhe-3"><div class="accordion-body"><div class="d-flex flex-column gap-3"><div class="d-flex flex-row justify-content-start align-items-end gap-3"><img class="speaker-image svelte-1l0ikvw" src="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/fcdabf2c159411eca865eeeeac1e3df9a6ee0244/full/!320%2C382/0/default" alt="Speaker Image Elder Dale G Renlund"> <div><h2>This is My Gospel - This is My Church</h2> <strong>Elder Dale G Renlund</strong> <br><small>Quorum of the Twelve Apostles</small></div></div>        <div class="d-flex gap-3"><div><p>For centuries. Black powder was the most powerful explosive available. They couldn't launch cannonballs. But it wasn't effective for most Mining and road construction projects. It was just too weak to shatter Rock. In 1846 an Italian chemist named escanius libero synthesized, a new explosive nitroglycerin. This oily fluid was, at least a thousand times more powerful than black powder. It can easily shatter Rock. Unfortunately, Dr. Wilson was in state. They should draft it from a small height can blow up. If it got too hot, it didn't blow up. If it got too cold, it would blow up.</p><p>Even placed in a cool dark room left alone. It would eventually blow up. Most countries, ban this Transportation and many Bandits manufacture. In 1860 a Swedish scientist named Alfred Nobel began trying to stabilize, nitro Lister after seven years of experimentation, he achieved his goal by absorbing nitroglycerin into a nearly worthless substance known as diatomaceous earth or diesel grip. Caseholder is a porous rock. That can be crumbled into a fine powder. When mixed with ask your question queselder, absorbs from Natric Western and the result in the paste can be shaken into sticks. In this form, nitroglycerin was much more stable.</p><p>It could be safely stored transported and used with unmanaged explosive power. Nobel named the combination of nitroglycerin and kieselguhr Dynamite. Dynamite changed the world. It could also make Nobel, wealthy. Without a stabilizer, nitroglycerin was just too hazardous to be commercially valuable. As Escanius Sobrero found out, By herself. As I mentioned, kieselguhr was of little value. But the combination of the two components made Dynamite, transformative and precious. In a similar way, the combination of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints provides powerful and transformative benefits for us.</p><p>The gospel's, perfect. But a divinely commissioned church is required to preach it. Maintain its security and administer his sacred ordinances with the Savior's power and authority. Consider the combination as I say his gospel and his church as established by the Book of Mormon Prophet Alma. The church was responsible for preaching. Nothing say we repentance and faith on the Lord. Who would rename his people? Using God's Authority. The church was responsible for administering. The ordinance of baptism in the name of the Lord. As a witness of entering into a covenant, with him to serve him and keep his Commandments.</p><p>The people who were baptized took on themselves, the name of Jesus Christ, joined his church. And were promised great power through the outpouring of the spirit. People flocked, the waters of Mormon. Where Alma preached the gospel. Though they revered those Waters from the surrounding forests. The Lord's Church was not a location or a building. Nor is it today. The church is simply ordinary people. Disciples of Jesus Christ. Gathered and organized into a divinely appointed structure, that helps the Lord accomplish his purposes. The church is the instrument through which we learn the central role of Jesus Christ in Heavenly Father's plan.</p><p>The church offers the authoritative way for individuals to participate in ordinances and make lasting covenants with God. Keeping those covenants draws us closer to God, gives us access to his power and transforms us into whom. He intends us to become. Just as Dynamite without nitroglycerin is unremarkable, the Savior's church is special only if it's built on his gospel. Without the Savior's gospel and the authority to administer the ordinances through the church, it isn't exceptional. Without the stabilizing effect of kieselguhr, nitroglycerin has limited value as an explosive. As history has shown. Without the Lord's Church, humanity's understanding of his gospel was likewise unstable.</p><p>Prone to doctrinal drift and subject to the influence of different religions, cultures, and philosophies. An amalgamation of those influences has been manifested. In every dispensation leading up to this last one. The gospel was initially revealed in its purity. The interpretation and application of that gospel gradually took on a form of godliness that lacked power. Because the divinely authorized framework was absent. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints enables access to God's power. Because it's authorized by him both to teach the doctrine of Christ and to offer the gospel's saving and exalting ordinances. The Savior yearns to forgive our sins. Help us access his power and transform us.</p><p>He suffered for our sins and longs to pardon us from the punishment that we otherwise would deserve. He wants us to become perfect and be perfected in him. Jesus Christ has the power to do this. He didn't simply sympathize with our imperfections and lament our eternal condemnation and the consequence of sin. No, he went beyond that—infinitely beyond that—and restored his church to enable access to his power. The core of the Gospel the church teaches is that Jesus Christ bore our griefs and carried our sorrows. He had laid on him the iniquity of us all.</p><p>He endured the cross, broke the bands of death, ascended into heaven, and sat down on the right hand of God, to claim from the Father his rights of mercy. The Savior did all this because he loves his Father. And he loves us. He's already paid the infinite price so he can claim all those who have faith in him and advocate for them. For us. Jesus Christ wants nothing more than for us to repent and come unto him so that he can justify and sanctify us. In this desire, he is relentless and unwavering. The access to God's covenantal power.</p><p>And his covenantal love is through his church. A combination of the Savior's gospel and his church transforms our lives. It transformed my maternal grandparents. My grandfather, Oscar Anderson, worked in a shipyard on Pied myself an island in the Stockton archipelago. His wife, Albertina, and their children lived on the Swedish mainland. Once every two weeks on a Saturday, Oscar rowed his boat home for the weekend before returning to work on Sunday evening. One day, while on the island, two American missionaries preached the restored Gospel of Jesus Christ. Oscar felt that what he heard was pure truth.</p><p>And he was filled with a spirit of joy. The next time he returned home, Oscar excitedly told Albertina all about the missionaries. He explained that he believed what they taught. He asked her to read the pamphlets they'd given. And he told her that he didn't think any of their future children should be baptized as infants. Albertina was furious and threw the pamphlets into the river. Not much was said between them before Oscar returned to work on Sunday evening. As soon as he was gone, Albertina retrieved those pamphlets. She carefully compared their doctrine.</p><p>With the teachings in her well-worn Bible. She was astonished to feel that what she read was true. The next time, Oscar returned home. He received a warm welcome. As to the copy of The Book of Mormon he brought with him. Albertina eagerly read it, again comparing the doctrine to that in her Bible. Like Oscar, she recognized pure truth. And was filled with unspeakable joy. Oscar, Albertina, and their children moved to Hersbro to be close to the few church members there. A week after Oscar and Albertina were baptized in 1916, Oscar was called to be the group leader in Hersbro.</p><p>Like many converts, Oscar and Albertina faced criticism because of their new faith. Local farmers refused to sell them milk. So, Oscar rowed across the fjord every day to purchase milk from a more tolerant farm. Yet, during the ensuing years, church membership in that area increased, in part because of Albertina's powerful testimony and burning missionary zeal. When the group became a branch, Oscar was called as the branch president. Members of that small branch were near that island. This was their 'Waters of Mormon.' This was where they came to acknowledge their religion. Over the years,</p><p>As they kept their baptismal covenants, Oscar and Albertina were transformed by the power of Jesus Christ. They longed to make more covenants and receive their temple blessings. To obtain those blessings, they permanently immigrated from their home in Sweden to Salt Lake City in 1949. Oscar had served as leader of the members in Hersbro for 33 years. The combination of nitroglycerin and kieselguhr made dynamite valuable. The combination of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and his church is beyond price. Oscar and Albertina heard about the restored gospel because a prophet of God had called and sent missionaries to Sweden by divine commission. The missionaries taught the doctrine of Christ and, by priesthood authority, baptized Oscar and Albertina as members.</p><p>They continued learning, developing, and growing as Latter-day Saints because they kept their covenants. The Savior refers to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as 'my church' because he commissioned it to accomplish his purposes: preaching his gospel, offering his ordinances and covenants, and making it possible for his power to justify and sanctify us. Without his restored church today, there is no authority, no preaching of revealed truths in his name, no ordinances or covenants, no manifestation of the power of godliness, no transformation into who God wants us to become, and God's plan for his children is set at naught. The church in this dispensation is integral to his plan. I invite you to commit yourself, more fully, to the Savior, his gospel, and his church.</p><p>As you do so, you'll find that the combination of the Savior's gospel and his church brings power into your life. This power is far greater than dynamite—it'll shatter the rocks in your way, transform you into an inheritor in God's kingdom, and you will be filled with that joy, which is unspeakable, full of glory. In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p></div> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-svelte-h="svelte-tyn8xv"><i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i></button></div></div> </div></div> </div></div> </div><div class="accordion" id="8hjr9zmx67nsigb1xkhe-4"><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapse-8hjr9zmx67nsigb1xkhe-4" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapse-8hjr9zmx67nsigb1xkhe-4"><span>Elder David P.

Homer</strong> <br><small>General Authority Seventy</small></div></div>        <div class="d-flex gap-3"><div><p>On June 1st of 1843 Addison Pratt left, Mambu Illinois to preach the gospel in the Hawaiian Islands. Leaving his wife, Louisa Barns Pratt, to care for their young family. As persecutions in Nauvoo intensified, forcing the Saints to leave, and later when a reporter just as they prepared to migrate to the Salt Lake Valley, Louisa faced the decision of whether to make the journey. It would have been easier to stay and to wait for Addison to return than to travel alone.</p><p>On both occasions, she sought guidance from the prophet Brigham Young, who encouraged her to go. Despite the great difficulty and her personal reluctance, she successfully made the journey each time. Initially, Louisa found little joy in traveling. However, she soon began to welcome the green prairie grass, the colorful wildflowers, and patches of ground along the riverbanks. The gloom on my mind wore gradually away, she recorded.</p><p>And there was not a more mirthful woman in the whole company. Louisa's story is deeply inspiring. I admire her willingness to set aside her personal preferences, her ability to trust God, and how exercising her faith helped her to see the situation differently. She has reminded me that we have a loving Father in Heaven who cares for us wherever we are.</p><p>And that we can trust him more than anyone or anything else. God trusts us to make many important decisions, and in all matters, he asks us to trust him. This is especially difficult when our judgment or public opinion differs from his will for his children. Some may suggest that we should redraw the lines between what is right and what is wrong, because they say that truth is relative, reality is self-defined, or that God is so generous that he does not actually care about what we do.</p><p>Yet, as we seek to understand and accept God's will, it is helpful to remember that the boundaries between right and wrong are not for us to define. God has established these boundaries himself based on eternal truths for our benefit and blessing. The desire to change God's eternal truth has a long history.</p><p>It started before the world began when Satan rebelled against God's plan, seeking selfishly to destroy human agency. Following this pattern, people like Sherem, Nihor, and Korihor have argued that faith is foolish, revelation is irrelevant, and whatever we want to do is right. Sadly, so very often, these deviations from God's truth have led to great sorrow.</p><p>While some things may depend on context, not everything does. President Russell M. Nelson has consistently taught that God's saving truths are absolute, eternal, and defined by God himself. When we choose to trust is one of life's important decisions. King Benjamin instructed his people, 'Believe in God, believe that he is... believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend.'</p><p>Fortunately, we have the scriptures and guidance from living prophets to help us understand God's truth. When clarification beyond what we have is needed, God provides it through his prophets, and he will respond to our sincere prayers through the Holy Ghost. As we seek to understand truths we do not yet fully appreciate, Elder Neil L. Andersen once taught that we should not be surprised if, at times, our personal views are not initially in harmony with the teachings of the Lord's prophets. 'These are moments of learning,' he said, 'of humility.'</p><p>When we go to our knees in prayer, we walk forward in faith, trusting in God, knowing that with time, we will receive more spiritual clarity from our Heavenly Father. At all times, it is helpful to remember Elder Neal A. Maxwell's teaching that 'God gives his word according to the attention and effort we devote to it.'</p><p>If we keep God's word, we will receive more. If we ignore his counsel, we will receive less until we have none. This loss of knowledge does not mean that the truth was wrong; rather, it shows that we have lost the capacity to understand it. In Capernaum, the Savior taught about his identity and mission. Many found his words difficult to hear, leading them to turn their backs and walk no more with him.</p><p>Why did they walk away? I guess they did not like what he said. So, trusting their own judgment, they walked away, denying themselves blessings that would have come if they had stayed.</p><p>It is easy for our pride to come between us and eternal truth. When we don't understand, we can pause, let our feelings settle, and then choose how to respond. The Savior urged us to 'look unto [him] in every thought; doubt not, fear not.' When we focus on the Savior, our faith can start to overcome our concerns.</p><p>As Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf encouraged us to do, 'Please first doubt your doubts before you doubt your faith.' We must never allow doubt to hold us prisoner and keep us from the divine love, peace, and gifts that come through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. As the disciples walked away from the Savior that day, he then asked the twelve, 'Will ye also go away?'</p><p>Peter answered, 'Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life. And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son of the living God.' Now, the apostles lived in the same world and faced the same social pressures as the disciples who walked away. However, in this moment, they chose their faith and trusted God, thus preserving the blessings God gives to those who stay. Perhaps you, like me, sometimes find yourself on both sides of this decision.</p><p>When we find it difficult to understand or embrace God's will, it is comforting to remember that he loves us as we are, wherever we are. And he has something better for us. If we reach out to him, he will assist us. While reaching out to him can be difficult, just as the father who sought healing for his son was told by the Savior, 'All things are possible to him that believeth,' in our moments of trouble,</p><p>We too can cry out, 'Help thou mine unbelief.' Elder Neal A. Maxwell once taught that 'the submission of one's will is really the only uniquely personal thing we have to place on God's altar.' No wonder King Benjamin was so eager that his people become as a child:</p><p>'Submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.' Always the Savior set the perfect example for us. With a heavy heart and knowing the painful work he had to do, he submitted to his Father's will, fulfilling his Messianic mission and opening the promise of eternity to you and me.</p><p>The choice to submit our will to God's is an act of faith that lies at the heart of our discipleship. In making that choice, we discover that our agency is not diminished; rather, it is magnified and rewarded by the presence of the Holy Ghost, who brings purpose, joy, peace, and hope</p><p>We can find nowhere else. Several months ago, a stake president and I visited a sister in his stake and her grown adult son. After years away from the church, wandering difficult and unfriendly paths, she had returned. During our visit, we asked her why she had come back. 'I made a mess of my life,' she said, 'and I knew where I needed to be.'</p><p>I then asked her what she had learned in her journey. With some emotion, she shared that she had learned that she needed to attend church long enough to break the habit of not coming and that she needed to stay until it was where she wanted to be. Her return was not easy.</p><p>But as she exercised faith in the Father's plan, she felt the Spirit return, and she added, 'I have learned for myself that God is good and that his ways are better than mine.' I bear witness of God, our Eternal Father, who loves us. Of his Son, Jesus Christ, who saved us.</p><p>They are aware of our hurts and challenges; they will never forsake us and know perfectly how to succor us. We can be of good cheer as we trust them more than anyone or anything else. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p></div> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-svelte-h="svelte-tyn8xv"><i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i></button></div></div> </div></div> </div></div> </div><div class="accordion" id="8hjr9zmx67nsigb1xkhe-5"><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapse-8hjr9zmx67nsigb1xkhe-5" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapse-8hjr9zmx67nsigb1xkhe-5"><span>Elder Gregorio E Casillas <br> <small>God Loves All His Children</small></span> </button></h2> <div id="flush-collapse-8hjr9zmx67nsigb1xkhe-5" class="accordion-collapse multi-collapse-8hjr9zmx67nsigb1xkhe collapse" data-bs-parent="#8hjr9zmx67nsigb1xkhe-5"><div class="accordion-body"><div class="d-flex flex-column gap-3"><div class="d-flex flex-row justify-content-start align-items-end gap-3"><img class="speaker-image svelte-1l0ikvw" src="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/61ce3ae9f37611ee8412eeeeac1e53829feaf94b/full/!320%2C400/0/default" alt="Speaker Image Elder Gregorio E Casillas"> <div><h2>God Loves All His Children</h2> <strong>Elder Gregorio E Casillas</strong> <br><small>General Authority Seventy</small></div></div>        <div class="d-flex gap-3"><div><p>What does our Heavenly Father desire from you? Do you understand that when you were in your premortal existence, Heavenly Father was preparing you for your life on Earth? Speaking to youth, President Russell M. Nelson taught, 'Our Heavenly Father has reserved many of his most noble Spirits, perhaps his finest, for this final phase.' Because we have been reserved for these latter days, it is crucial for us to learn to be disciples of Jesus Christ. The Lord Jesus Christ is the Good Shepherd, and he knows his flock, and the flock knows his Shepherd because he calleth his own sheep by name.</p><p>He is always calling upon us, and he uses us, his ordinary servants, to help bring his children to him. A while ago, a stake president and I were visiting members of the church in a local neighborhood. After we finished our scheduled visits, the stake president asked me if we could go see one family. He felt impressed that we should talk with them. We knocked on the door, and a sister opened it. She looked at me, but she didn’t know who I was, so she didn’t express much. I pointed my hand towards the stake president, who greeted her by name. As soon as she heard and saw him, she rejoiced, standing there at the door. They both hugged each other and cried together.</p><p>This set the tone for our visit. We didn’t know that this sister had received chemotherapy the day before. She felt too weak to care for her adult son. So, I helped the stake president dress her son, and we put him in his wheelchair. We fed him the food that another sweet sister from the ward had brought earlier, and we helped with other tasks. Before we left their home, we were able to bless them. All that was going through my mind during this visit was a confirmation that Jesus Christ loves them deeply. He understands them and personally knows the pain of their unique situation.</p><p>Almost the entire visit happened in silence. On this occasion, we did not give a big sermon or share our favorite scripture. But the Lord blessed us with his Spirit abundantly. One of the greatest reasons your Heavenly Father sent you here at this time is so that you can realize your full potential. Christ's gospel teaches us that as disciples of Christ, we should avoid comparing ourselves to one another. Your spiritual abilities are unique, personal, and innate, and your Heavenly Father wants to help you develop them. There will always be someone you can help feel the love of your Heavenly Father.</p><p>Your potential is divine. While it is certainly important to prepare yourself to succeed in this very competitive world, one of your crucial missions throughout your life is to become a disciple of Jesus Christ and to follow the impressions of the Spirit. As you do these things, God will bless your life, he will bless your current or future family, and he will bless the lives of his children that you encounter. We live in a time of great opportunity, although we face many difficulties. I know they are there, in part, to allow us to help others feel the love of our Heavenly Father.</p><p>President Nelson said that in coming days we will see the greatest manifestations of the Savior’s power that the world has ever seen. We have the courage to reach out to people who need a helping hand, embrace them with comfort, or simply be with them in silence. If we can help lighten their burdens, even if only for a moment, then we will be able to see the great manifestations of the Savior's power in their lives. As disciples of Jesus Christ, Latter-day Saints can make a positive difference in the world. We can provide a sense of joy that is reflected in our countenance, a joy that we share with words of love and acts of kindness.</p><p>Let us be good neighbors, good employers, and good workers. Let us strive to be good Christians at all times. The Lord has restored his gospel with the necessary ordinances so that Heavenly Father's children can have all the promises that bind us to him. By helping our brothers and sisters in their daily challenges, let us also remember to help them make and keep sacred covenants with their Heavenly Father, so that he, in turn, can promise them the richest blessings for this life and for eternity. These blessings are only made possible through the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ and his priesthood power.</p><p>In other words, we can help others stay on the covenant path. Some of us deviate from the path from time to time, and so we must remember that for our Heavenly Father, we always have the possibility of returning. Really, the course does not need to be perfect. The Savior always reminds us that as often as we repent and seek forgiveness with real intent, we will be forgiven. One of the traps of the adversary today is to make us think and believe that there is no way for us to change or that we no longer have hope. This destructive thinking has caused many of us to stop trying.</p><p>And it is at this moment when our love, our words of encouragement, our support, our time, and our help can lift someone high enough to try once more. Maybe you are thinking, 'Okay, but who ministers to me?' By going and blessing the lives of our brothers and sisters, we will collect testimonies that will fill our lives with faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. These testimonies will revitalize us to try once more ourselves. The Holy Spirit will revive us and help us with renewed testimonies to continue with our own difficulties and personal trials. Whenever we seek to bless the lives of others, the Lord takes mercy upon us even more. He strengthens us and helps us in our lives. Please remember that the Lord Jesus Christ is your Savior and understands you personally. He knows what it is to have to fulfill a calling and leave things behind to help the children of God.</p><p>He has the power to bless you in everything if you trust him and do not doubt. My dear brothers and sisters, as we visited a mother and her son that we did not have on our agenda, I proclaim that God knew they needed us. And in the end, I was the one who was ministered to. On that visit, I received one of the greatest assurances of the Savior’s love for us. I testify that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world, that he lived and died for you and me, and that he was resurrected for you and me so that we can aspire to celestial reunions full of joy with those who have already passed to the other side of the veil.</p><p>I know that he understands you and me perfectly. He understands each of our difficult moments, and he has the power to help us in those moments where we feel most vulnerable. I love that the Lord Jesus Christ and our Heavenly Father appeared to Joseph Smith to restore the gospel in these latter days. I know that President Russell M. Nelson is a prophet of the Lord, and I testify of this in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p></div> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-svelte-h="svelte-tyn8xv"><i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i></button></div></div> </div></div> </div></div> </div><div class="accordion" id="8hjr9zmx67nsigb1xkhe-6"><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapse-8hjr9zmx67nsigb1xkhe-6" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapse-8hjr9zmx67nsigb1xkhe-6"><span>Elder Dallin H Oaks <br> <small>Following Christ</small></span> </button></h2> <div id="flush-collapse-8hjr9zmx67nsigb1xkhe-6" class="accordion-collapse multi-collapse-8hjr9zmx67nsigb1xkhe collapse" data-bs-parent="#8hjr9zmx67nsigb1xkhe-6"><div class="accordion-body"><div class="d-flex flex-column gap-3"><div class="d-flex flex-row justify-content-start align-items-end gap-3"><img class="speaker-image svelte-1l0ikvw" src="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/db96515429b848527e30220394ba6299c297236a/full/!320%2C384/0/default" alt="Speaker Image Elder Dallin H Oaks"> <div><h2>Following Christ</h2> <strong>Elder Dallin H Oaks</strong> <br><small>First Presidency - First Counselor</small></div></div>        <div class="d-flex gap-3"><div><p>Here, millions have been inspired by the gospel study plan, and one of the Savior's invitations, 'Come, follow me.' Following Christ is not a casual or occasional practice. It is a continuous commitment and way of life that should guide us at all times and in all places. His teachings and his example were refined for every disciple of Jesus Christ, and all are invited to this path. For he invites all to come unto him—black and white, bond and free, male and female—and all are alike unto God. The first step in following Christ is to obey what he defined as the great commandment in the law.</p><p>'Thou shalt love the Lord, thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.' On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.' The commandments of God provide the guiding and steadying love force in our lives. Our experiences in mortality are like the little boy and his father flying a kite on a windy day. As the kite rose higher, the winds caused it to tug on the connecting string and the Lord’s hand.</p><p>Experiencing the force of mortal winds, the boy proposed to cut the string so the kite could rise higher. His wise father counseled no, explaining that the string is what holds the kite in place against mortal winds. If we lose our hold on the string, the kite will not rise higher. It will be carried about by these winds and inevitably crash to the earth. The string represents the covenants that connect us to God, our Heavenly Father, and his Son, Jesus Christ. As we honor those covenants by keeping the commandments and following their plan of redemption,</p><p>The promised blessings enable us to soar to celestial heights. The Book of Mormon frequently declares that Christ is the light of the world. During his appearance to the Nephites, he proclaimed, 'I am the light which ye shall hold up—that which ye have seen me do.' He is our role model. We learn what he has said and done by studying the scriptures and following prophetic teachings, as President Russell M. Nelson has urged us to do. In the ordinance of the sacrament, we covenant each Sabbath day that we will always remember him and keep his commandments. In the Book of Mormon, the Lord gave us the fundamentals in what he called the doctrine of Christ. These are faith in the Lord Jesus Christ,</p><p>Repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, enduring to the end, and becoming as a little child, which means to trust the Lord and submit to all he requires of us. The Lord’s commandments include two types—permanent, like the doctrine of Christ, and temporary. Temporary commandments are those necessary for the needs of the Lord’s work or the faithful in temporary circumstances but are to be set aside when the need is passed. An example of temporary commandments is the Lord’s directions to the early leadership of the church to move the Saints from New York to Ohio,</p><p>In Missouri, Illinois, and finally to lead the pioneer exodus to the Intermountain West. Though temporary, when still in force, these commandments were given to be obeyed. Some permanent commandments have taken considerable time to be generally understood. For example, President Lorenzo Snow's famous sermon on the law of tithing emphasized a commandment given earlier but not yet generally observed by church members. It needed re-emphasis in the circumstances then faced by the church and its members. Recent examples of re-emphasis have also been needed because of current circumstances faced by the Latter-day Saints or the church.</p><p>These include the proclamation on the family issued by President Gordon B. Hinckley a generation ago, and President Russell M. Nelson’s recent call for the church to be known by its revealed name, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Another of our Savior’s teachings that requires re-emphasis in the circumstances of our day is the avoidance of contention. This is a time of many harsh and hurtful words in public communications and sometimes even in our families. A short difference on issues of public policy often results in anger, hostility, and even hatred in public and personal relationships. This atmosphere of enmity sometimes even paralyzes capacities for lawmaking,</p><p>On matters of importance, where most citizens see an urgent need for action in the public interest. What should followers of Christ teach and do in this time of toxic communications? What were his teachings and examples? It is significant that among the first principles Jesus taught when he appeared to the Nephites was to avoid contention. While he taught this in the context of disputes over religious doctrine, the reasons he gave clearly apply to communications and relationships in politics, public policy, and family relationships. Jesus taught, 'He that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention,</p><p>And he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another. Behold, this is not my doctrine, to stir up the hearts of men with anger, one against another. But this is my doctrine, that such things should be done away.' In his remaining ministry among the Nephites, Jesus taught other commandments closely related to this prohibition of contention. We know from the Bible that he had previously taught each of these in his great Sermon on the Mount, usually in precisely the same language. He later gave them to the Nephites as well.</p><p>The commandment, by that language, 'Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you.' This is one of Christ’s best-known commandments, most revolutionary, and most difficult to follow. Yet it is a most wonderful part of his invitation for all to follow him. As President David O. McKay taught, 'There is no better way to manifest love for God than to show an unselfish love for one’s fellow man.' Here is another fundamental teaching by him who is our role model, 'Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.'</p><p>How it would change personal relationships if followers of Christ would forego harsh and hurtful words in all their communications. In general conference last year, President Russell M. Nelson gave us these challenges: 'One of the easiest ways to identify a true follower of Christ is how compassionately that person treats other people. True disciples of Jesus Christ are peacemakers. One of the best ways we can honor the Savior is to become a peacemaker.' His conclusion in these teachings: 'Contention is a choice. Peacemaking is a choice. You have your agency to choose contention or reconciliation. I urge you to choose to be a peacemaker now and always.'</p><p>Potential adversaries should begin their discussions by identifying common ground on which all agree. To follow our perfect role model and his prophet, we need to practice what is popularly known as the Golden Rule: 'All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them, for this is the law and the prophets.' We need to love and do good to all. We need to avoid contention and be peacemakers in all our communications. This does not mean to compromise our principles and priorities, but to cease harshly attacking others for theirs.</p><p>That is what our perfect role model did in his ministry. That is the example he set for us as he invited us to follow him. In this conference four years ago, President Nelson gave us a prophetic challenge for our own day: 'Are you willing to let God prevail in your life? Are you willing to let God be the most important influence in your life? Will you allow his words, his commandments, and his covenants to influence what you do each day? Will you allow his voice to take priority over any other?' As followers of Christ, we teach and testify of Jesus Christ,</p><p>Our perfect role model. So, let us follow him. Avoid contention. And even as we pursue our preferred policies and public actions, let us qualify for his blessings by using the language and methods of peacemakers. In our families and other personal relationships, let us avoid harsh and hateful words. Let us seek to be more like our Savior, in whose holy name I testify and invoke his blessings to help us be Saints. In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p></div> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-svelte-h="svelte-tyn8xv"><i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i></button></div></div> </div></div> </div></div> </div> <div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center"><h2 class="h2">Afternoon Session</h2> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target=".multi-collapse-mfa2cbya08v0oj176io1" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="multiCollapseExample1 multiCollapseExample2">Toggle All</button></div></div> <div class="accordion" id="mfa2cbya08v0oj176io1-0"><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapse-mfa2cbya08v0oj176io1-0" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapse-mfa2cbya08v0oj176io1-0"><span>Elder D.

Todd Christofferson"> <div><h2>Burying Our Weapons of Rebellion</h2> <strong>Elder D. Todd Christofferson</strong> <br><small>Quorum of the Twelve Apostles</small></div></div>        <div class="d-flex gap-3"><div><p>Successful efforts have been made with many generations. Bring away by people to a belief in the doctrine of Christ. This time, however, through the miraculous interventions of the Holy Spirit, that wasn't super late nights were converted and became Disciples of Jesus Christ. And as sure as the Lord was with us, so sure as many as believed or as many as were brought to the knowledge of the truth through the preaching of Alma and his brethren, according to the spirit of revelation and prophecy and the power of God working miracles in them. Yea, I say unto you, as the Lord liveth, as many of the Lamanites as believed in their preaching and were converted unto the Lord never did fall away.</p><p>The key to the enduring conversion of this people is stated in the next verse: where they became a righteous people. They did lay down the weapons of their rebellion, that they did not fight against God anymore, neither against any of their brethren. This reference to weapons of rebellion was both literal and figurative, and meant their swords and other weapons of war, but also their disobedience to God and His commandments. The king of these converted Lamanites expressed addition: 'And now behold, my brethren, it has been all we can do to repent of all our sins and many murders, which we have committed, and to get God to take them away from our hearts.'</p><p>What was all we can do to repent sufficiently before God, that he would take away our stain. The king's words there are sincere repentance that led not only to forgiveness of their sins, but God also took away the stain of those sins and even the desire to sin from their hearts. As you know, rather than risk any possible return to their prior state of warring against God, they buried their swords. And as they buried their physical weapons with changed hearts, they also buried their disposition to sin. We might ask ourselves, what could we do to follow this pattern?</p><p>To lay down the weapons of our rebellion, whatever they may be, and become so converted to the Lord that the stain of sin and the desire for sin are taken away from our hearts, and we will never fall away. Rebellion can be active or passive. The classic example of willful rebellion is Lucifer, who in the premortal world opposed the Father’s plan of redemption and rallied others to oppose it as well. And a third part of the hosts of heaven followed after him. It is not hard to discern the impact of this continuing rebellion in our own time. The unholy trio of antichrists, Sherem, Nihor, and Korihor,</p><p>Provide a classic study of active rebellion against God. The overarching thesis of Korihor was that there is no sin. Therefore, there is no need for repentance and there is no Savior. Every man prospers according to his genius, and every man conquers according to his strength, and whatsoever a man does is no crime. The antichrist rejects religious authority, characterizing ordinances and covenants as performances laid down by ancient priests to usurp power and authority. A later example of willful rebellion with a happier ending is the story of William David Phelps. Phelps joined the church in 1831 and was appointed church printer. He edited several early church publications, wrote numerous hymns,</p><p>And served as a scribe to Joseph Smith. Unfortunately, he turned against the church and the prophet, even to the point of giving a false testimony against Joseph Smith in a Missouri court, which contributed to the prophet’s imprisonment there. Later, Phelps wrote to Joseph asking for forgiveness. 'I know my situation; you know it; God knows it. And I want to be saved if my friends will help me.' In his reply, the prophet stated, 'It is true that we have suffered much in consequence of your behavior. However, the cup has been drunk, the bitter has been swallowed; we are yet alive.'</p><p>'Come on, dear brother, since the war is past, for friends at first, are friends again at last.' With sincere repentance, William Phelps buried his weapons of rebellion and was received once more in full fellowship, never again to fall away. Perhaps the more insidious form of rebellion against God, however, is the passive version: ignoring His will in our lives. Many who would never consider active rebellion may still oppose the will and the word of God by pursuing their own path without regard for divine direction. I am reminded of the song made famous years ago by singer Frank Sinatra,</p><p>With the climactic line, 'I did it my way.' There is, no doubt, much to admire in determination and individual choice, but when it comes to matters of salvation and eternal life, all things are to be done in God’s way, for truly there is no other way. Take, for instance, the Savior’s example regarding baptism. He submitted to baptism as a demonstration of loyalty to the Father and as an example to us. 'To show unto the children of men that, according to the flesh, he humbleth himself before the Father.' He humbled himself before the Father, obeying His commandments,</p><p>And he said unto the children of men, 'Follow thou me.' Wherefore, my beloved brethren, can we follow Jesus, save we shall be willing to keep the commandments of the Father? There is no 'my way.' If we are to follow Christ’s example, we must abandon the idea of finding our own way to heaven. That is like the futility of working on the Tower of Babel. In looking to Christ and His salvation, the swords and other weapons that the Lamanites buried were weapons of rebellion because of how they used them.</p><p>The same kinds of weapons in the hands of their sons, being used in defense of family and freedom, were not weapons of rebellion against God and war. The same is true with such weapons in the hands of the Nephites. They were not fighting for monarchy nor power, but were fighting for their homes, their liberties, their lives, their children, and their all—yea, for their rights of worship and their church. In this same way, there are things in our lives that may be neutral or even inherently good, but when used in the wrong way,</p><p>Become weapons of rebellion. Our speech, for example, can edify or tear down. As James said, 'But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison. Therewith bless we God, even the Father, and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God. Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.' There is much in public and personal discourse today that is malicious and mean-spirited. There is much conversation that is vulgar, profane, even abusive. This sort of speech is a weapon of rebellion against God.</p><p>Consider another example of something that is essentially good that could be turned against divine directives: a person’s career. One can find real satisfaction in a profession, a vocation of service, and all of us are benefited by what devoted and talented people in many fields of endeavor accomplish or create. Still, it is possible that devotion to a career can become the paramount objective in life, and all else becomes secondary, including any claim the Savior may make on one’s time and talents. For men and women as well, undue ambition and opportunities for career advancement can lead one to neglect or fail to nurture one’s spouse,</p><p>And raise virtuous children, or even intentionally avoid the blessing and responsibility of childbearing solely for the sake of career advancement. This can convert laudable achievement into a form of rebellion. Another example concerns our physical being. Paul reminds us that we are to glorify God in both body and spirit and that this body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, which we have of God and we are not our own. Thus, we have a legitimate interest in spending time caring for our bodies as best we can. Heroes who reach the peak of performance have demonstrated this, as we’ve seen recently in the achievements of Olympic and Paralympic athletes.</p><p>Some of us are experiencing the effects of age or what President M. Russell Ballard called the 'rivets of mortality.' Nevertheless, I believe it pleases our Creator when we do our best to care for this wonderful gift of a physical body. It would be a mark of rebellion to defile or abuse this body or fail to pursue a healthy lifestyle. At the same time, vanity—becoming consumed with one’s physique, appearance, or dress—can be a form of rebellion at the other extreme, leading one to worship God’s gift instead of God.</p><p>In the end, burying weapons of rebellion against God simply means yielding to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, putting off the natural man, and becoming a saint through the Atonement of Christ the Lord. It means putting the first commandment first in our lives. It means letting God prevail. If our love of God and our determination to serve him with all our heart, might, mind, and strength become the touchstone by which we judge all things and make all our decisions, we will have buried the weapons of rebellion. By the grace of Christ, God will forgive our sins from the past. He will take away the stain of those sins.</p><p>And He will take away any desire for evil, as He did with those Lamanites of old. Thereafter, we too will never fall away. Burying our weapons of rebellion leads to a unique joy shared with all who have ever become converted to the Lord and who sing the song of redeeming love. Our Heavenly Father and His Son, our Redeemer, have confirmed their unending commitment to our ultimate happiness through the most profound love and sacrifice. We experience their love daily. Surely we can reciprocate with our own love and loyalty. May we bury, very deep,</p><p>Any element of rebellion against God in our lives, and replace it with a willing heart and a willing mind. In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p></div> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-svelte-h="svelte-tyn8xv"><i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i></button></div></div> </div></div> </div></div> </div><div class="accordion" id="mfa2cbya08v0oj176io1-1"><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapse-mfa2cbya08v0oj176io1-1" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapse-mfa2cbya08v0oj176io1-1"><span>Elder José A.

Teixeira</strong> <br><small>General Authority Seventy</small></div></div>        <div class="d-flex gap-3"><div><p>In covenants, with an everlasting combat, we got counted as the salt of the earth. Salt is made of two elements bounded together. We cannot be salt on our own. If we are to be the salt of the earth, we must be bounded to the Lord. And that is what I see as I meet up with members of the church around the world. I see faithful members of the church bound to the Lord, committed in their efforts to serve others and being the salt of the earth. Your unwavering dedication is a shining example. Your service is appreciated and cherished.</p><p>You have shown remarkable courage and devotion. The youth have enthusiastically embraced the work of family history, and their frequent visits to the house of the Lord are a testament to their dedication. Their willingness to devote time and energy to serve missions across the globe reflects a deep inner bond to Christ. They are not merely participating, but leading the way in becoming disciples, bound to Jesus Christ. Their service radiates light and touches countless lives. To you, the youth of the church, we express our heartfelt thanks for your inspiring service—not just as the future but as the present salt of the earth.</p><p>I love the Lord, Jesus Christ, and I feel blessed by the opportunity to serve alongside you in the Lord's church. Grounded in our covenants, we are reassured that we are never alone in this journey. Together, we can continue to build the kingdom of God, rooted in service, love, and unwavering faith in Jesus Christ. By the Sea of Galilee, Jesus often used everyday elements familiar to his audience to convey profound spiritual truths. One such element was salt. Jesus declared, 'Ye are the salt of the earth,' a statement rich in meaning and significance, especially for the people of his time, who understood the multifaceted value of salt.</p><p>The ancient craft of salt harvesting in the Algarve, the southern region of my home country of Portugal, dates back thousands of years to the era of the Roman Empire. Remarkably, the methods used by the salt workers, known as marinhos, have changed little since then. These dedicated artisans employ traditional techniques, performing their work entirely by hand, maintaining a legacy that has endured through the centuries. This ancient method harvests what is called flor de sal, or 'flower of salt.' To fully appreciate the intricate process of harvesting this flower of salt, it is essential to understand the environment in which it is produced. The Algarve's coastal salt marshes provide the ideal conditions for salt production. Seawater is channeled into large shallow pans, known as salinas, where it is left to evaporate under the heat of the sun.</p><p>As the water evaporates, the flower of salt forms delicate crystals on the surface of the salt pans. These crystals are incredibly pure and have a unique crisp texture. The marinhos carefully skim the crystals from the water’s surface, much like cream is skimmed from the top of milk. The process requires great skill and precision. Just as the marinhos put forth great efforts to ensure they harvest the highest quality salt, so should we, as the Lord’s covenant people, always do our very best so that our love and example are as pure as possible—a reflection of our Savior, Jesus Christ.</p><p>In the ancient world, salt was more than just a seasoning. It was a vital preservative and a symbol of purity and covenant. People knew that salt was essential for preserving food and enhancing its flavor. They also understood the grave implications of salt losing its saltiness, or savor, by becoming contaminated or diluted. Salt can lose its excellence. We can also lose our spiritual vitality if our faith in Jesus Christ becomes casual. We may look the same on the outside, but without a stronger inner faith, we lose our ability to make a difference in the world and to bring out the best in those around us.</p><p>So how can we channel our energy and efforts to make a difference and be the change the world needs today? How can we preserve discipleship and continue to be a positive influence? The words of our prophet do echo in my mind, and I quote, 'God wants us to work together and help each other. That is why he sent us to Earth in families and organizes us into wards and stakes. That is why he asks us to live in the world but not be of it.'</p><p>When our lives are filled with purpose and service, we avoid spiritual apathy. On the other hand, when our lives are deprived of divine truths, meaningful service to others, and sacred opportunities for pondering and reflection, we gradually become suffocated by our own inactivity and self-interest, risking losing our savor. The antidote to this is to continue being involved in service, being anxiously engaged in good works, and improving ourselves and society.</p><p>Dear brothers and sisters, what a blessing we all have today to belong to The Church of Jesus Christ and to have the opportunity to serve in His church. Our circumstances may vary, but we can all make a difference. Remember the marinhos, the salt workers? They use simple tools to harvest the best crystals, the best salt. We too can do simple things that, with consistent efforts in small and meaningful acts, can deepen our discipleship and commitment to Jesus Christ. Here are four examples of how we can strive to be the salt of the earth.</p><p>First, keep the house of the Lord at the center of your devotion. Now that temples are closer than ever before, prioritizing regular worship in the house of the Lord will help us focus on what matters most and keep our lives centered in Christ. In the temple, we find the height of our faith in Jesus Christ and the soul of our devotion to Him.</p><p>Second, be deliberate in uplifting others by living the gospel together. We can strengthen our families through consistent and intentional efforts to bring gospel principles into our lives and into our homes.</p><p>Third, be willing to accept a calling and serve in the church. Service in our local congregations allows us to support one another and grow together. While service may sometimes be inconvenient, it is always rewarding.</p><p>And finally, use digital communication tools with purpose. Today, digital communication tools allow us to connect as never before. Like most of you, I use these tools to connect with brothers and sisters in the church and with my family and friends. As I connect with them, I feel closer to them. We can minister to each other in times of need when we cannot be physically present. These tools are intended for our blessing.</p><p>Yet these very same tools can drag us away from meaningful interactions and eventually cause us to waste our time in less purposeful activities. Striving to be the salt of the earth includes much more than endlessly scrolling through reels on a six-inch screen.</p><p>As we keep the house of the Lord central in our lives, intentionally strengthen others by living the gospel, accept callings to serve, and use digital tools with purpose, we can preserve our spiritual vitality. Just as salt in its purest form has the power to enhance and preserve, so too does our faith in Jesus Christ when it is nourished and protected by our dedication to Christlike service and love.</p><p>As we remain bound to the Lord, our lives will naturally reflect His light, and we will become the salt of the earth. In this sense, we not only enrich our lives, but also strengthen our families and our communities.</p><p>May we strive to maintain this bond with the Lord, never lose our savor, and be the small yet powerful crystals of salt that the Lord wants us to be. In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p></div> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-svelte-h="svelte-tyn8xv"><i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i></button></div></div> </div></div> </div></div> </div><div class="accordion" id="mfa2cbya08v0oj176io1-2"><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapse-mfa2cbya08v0oj176io1-2" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapse-mfa2cbya08v0oj176io1-2"><span>Elder Juan Pablo Villar <br> <small>His Hand Ready to Help Us</small></span> </button></h2> <div id="flush-collapse-mfa2cbya08v0oj176io1-2" class="accordion-collapse multi-collapse-mfa2cbya08v0oj176io1 collapse" data-bs-parent="#mfa2cbya08v0oj176io1-2"><div class="accordion-body"><div class="d-flex flex-column gap-3"><div class="d-flex flex-row justify-content-start align-items-end gap-3"><img class="speaker-image svelte-1l0ikvw" src="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/fd135217d3c211eb82bceeeeac1e9356443c7aec/full/!320%2C400/0/default" alt="Speaker Image Elder Juan Pablo Villar"> <div><h2>His Hand Ready to Help Us</h2> <strong>Elder Juan Pablo Villar</strong> <br><small>General Authority Seventy</small></div></div>        <div class="d-flex gap-3"><div><p>We will recognize Jesus Christ as a flawless example of ministry. There is a pattern for us in the scriptures when he or his disciples reach out to someone in need for help, rescue, or a blessing. As they reach out with their hands, they are offering divine aid. As in my story, I knew my brother was there, but being there for me was not enough. He knew I was in trouble, and he went to help lift me from the water. Occasionally, we think that we only need to be there for someone in need. And many times, there is more we can do. Having an eternal perspective</p><p>Can help us receive revelation to offer timely assistance to others in need. We can rely on the guidance and inspiration of the Holy Ghost to discern what kind of help is needed, whether it is temporal support like emotional comfort, food, aid with daily tasks, or spiritual guidance to help others on their journey to prepare for, make, and honor sacred covenants. When Peter, the senior Apostle, walked on the water to go to Jesus, he was afraid and began to sink. Then he cried out, saying, 'Lord, save me.' Jesus knew the faith Peter had exercised to come unto him on the water.</p><p>He was also aware of Peter's fear. According to the account, Jesus immediately stretched forth his hand and caught him, saying the following words: 'O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?' His words were not to scold Peter, but to remind him that He, the Messiah, was with him and the disciples. If we think celestial, we will receive the confirmation in our hearts that Jesus Christ is indeed our rescuer, our advocate with the Father. As we exercise faith in Him, He will save us from our hardships, our challenges, and our daily needs in this temporal life, and give us the greatest of all gifts, which is eternal life.</p><p>My brother did not give up on me that day, but persisted so I could learn how to do it for myself. He persisted, even if that required rescuing me twice. He persisted, even if I could not get it at first. He persisted so I could overcome that challenge and succeed. If we think celestial, we will realize that our Savior will be there as many times as necessary to provide help if we want to learn, change, overcome, grow, or succeed in whatever will bring true and everlasting happiness to our lives. The scriptures immortalize the symbol and significance of the Savior's hands.</p><p>In his atoning sacrifice, his hands were pierced by nails to fix him on the cross. After his resurrection, he appeared to his disciples in a perfect body, but the prints in his hands remained as a reminder of his infinite sacrifice. The scar will always be there for us, even if we cannot see it or feel it at first, because He was chosen by our Heavenly Father to be our Savior, the Redeemer of all humankind. If I think celestial, I know that we are not left alone in this life. While we must face challenges and trials, our Heavenly Father knows our capabilities and knows we can bear or overcome our difficulties. We must do our part and turn to Him in faith. His beloved Son, Jesus Christ, is our rescuer.</p><p>He will always be there. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p></div> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-svelte-h="svelte-tyn8xv"><i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i></button></div></div> </div></div> </div></div> </div><div class="accordion" id="mfa2cbya08v0oj176io1-3"><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapse-mfa2cbya08v0oj176io1-3" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapse-mfa2cbya08v0oj176io1-3"><span>Elder Patrick Kearon <br> <small>Welcome to the Church of Joy</small></span> </button></h2> <div id="flush-collapse-mfa2cbya08v0oj176io1-3" class="accordion-collapse multi-collapse-mfa2cbya08v0oj176io1 collapse" data-bs-parent="#mfa2cbya08v0oj176io1-3"><div class="accordion-body"><div class="d-flex flex-column gap-3"><div class="d-flex flex-row justify-content-start align-items-end gap-3"><img class="speaker-image svelte-1l0ikvw" src="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/ac500c69e6cf11ee9cf8eeeeac1e0ca1df2f8544/full/!320%2C384/0/default" alt="Speaker Image Elder Patrick Kearon"> <div><h2>Welcome to the Church of Joy</h2> <strong>Elder Patrick Kearon</strong> <br><small>Quorum of the Twelve Apostles</small></div></div>        <div class="d-flex gap-3"><div><p>Baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on Christmas Eve of 1987, nearly 37 years ago. That was a truly wonderful day in my life and my eternal journey, and I'm profoundly grateful for the friends who prepared the way and brought me to the waters of that new birth. Whether your baptism was yesterday or years ago, whether you meet in a large multi-ward church building or under a fast canopy, whether you receive the sacrament and remember the Savior in Thai or Swahili, I would like to say to you, welcome to the Church of Joy.</p><p>Welcome to the Church of Joy. Because of the loving plan of our Heavenly Father for each of His children, and because of the redeeming life and mission of our Savior, Jesus Christ, we can, and should be, the most joyful people on Earth. Even as the storms of life and a troubled world surround us, we can cultivate a growing and abiding sense of joy and inner peace because of our hope in Christ and our understanding of our own place in the beautiful plan of happiness. Our senior Apostle, President Russell M. Nelson, has spoken of the joy that comes from a life centered on Jesus Christ.</p><p>In nearly every address he has given since becoming the President of the Church, he summed it up so concisely: 'Joy comes from and because of Him.' As Latter-day Saints, Jesus Christ is Joy. We are members of The Church of Jesus Christ. We are members of the Church of Joy. And where should our joy as a people be more apparent than when we gather together in our sacrament worship to praise the source of all joy? Here we assemble with our ward and branch families to celebrate the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper and to live in the deliverance from sin and death, thanks to His powerful grace.</p><p>Here we come to experience the joy, refuge, forgiveness, thanksgiving, and belonging found through Jesus Christ. Is this spirit of collective rejoicing in Christ what you find? Is this what you bring? Maybe you think this doesn’t have much to do with you, or perhaps you’re simply used to how things have always been done. But we can all contribute—no matter our age or our calling—to making our sacrament meetings the joy-filled, Christ-focused gatherings they can and should be. Is joyful reverence a thing, you may ask?</p><p>Oh yes, it is. We deeply love, honor, and respect our God, and our reverence flows from a soul that rejoices in Christ’s abundant love, mercy, and salvation. This joyful reverence to the Lord characterizes our sacred sacrament meetings. However, for many, reverence only means folding our arms tightly around our chest, bowing our heads, closing our eyes, and holding still indefinitely.</p><p>This might be a helpful way to teach energetic young children, but as we grow and learn, let us see that reverence is so much more than this. Is that how we would be if the Savior were with us? 'In thy presence is fullness of joy.' For many of us, this transformation in how we approach sacrament services will take practice. We do not gather on the Sabbath simply to attend sacrament meeting and check it off a list. We come together to worship. There is a significant difference between the two: to attend means to be present, but to worship is to intentionally praise and adore our God in a way that transforms us.</p><p>As we gather in remembrance of the Savior and the redemption He has made possible, our faces should reflect our joy and gratitude. Elder F. Enzio Busche once told the story of when he was a branch president and a young boy in the congregation looked at him on the stand and asked loudly, 'What is the man with that mean face doing up there?' Those who sit on the stand, whether speakers, leaders, choirs, and those who gather in the congregation communicate to each other this welcome to the Church of Joy through the expressions they wear on their faces. As we sing, are we joining together to praise our God and King? No matter the quality of our voices, are we just mumbling or not singing at all?</p><p>Scripture records that 'the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me'—it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads. So, let’s sing and praise Him! We center our testimonies on Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, and the fruit of humbly living their gospel—fruits that are sweet above all that is sweet. Then, we truly feast, and feel that we hunger not, neither do we thirst, and our burdens become lighter through the joy of the Son. The glorious focal point of our services is the blessing and receiving of the sacrament itself—the bread and the water that represent the eternal gift of our Lord and the whole purpose of our gathering.</p><p>This is the sacred time for spiritual renewal when we witness anew that we are willing to take upon us the name of Jesus Christ and make again a covenant to always remember the Savior and keep His commandments. Yes, in some seasons of life, we may approach the sacrament table with heavy hearts and overwhelming loads. At other times, we come free of the burdens and cares of life. As we listen intently to the breaking of the bread and the water and partake of those sacred emblems, we may feel to reflect on the sacrifice of the Savior—His agony in Gethsemane, His anguish on the cross, and the sorrows and pains</p><p>He endured on our behalf. That may be what relieves our souls as we connect our suffering to His. At other times, we will feel to wonder in grateful awe at the exquisite and sweet joy of what Jesus's magnificent gift has made possible in our lives and in our eternities. We will rejoice for what is yet to come—our glorious reunion with our beloved Father and risen Savior. We may have been conditioned to suppose that the purpose of the sacrament is to sit in the pew thinking only about all the ways we messed up during the week before.</p><p>But let’s turn that practice on its head. In the stillness, we can ponder the many ways we have seen the Lord relentlessly pursue us with His wonderful love that week. We can reflect on what it means to discover the joy of daily repentance. We can give thanks for the times the Savior entered into our sorrows and our triumphs and the occasions where we felt His grace, forgiveness, and power lifting us to overcome our hardships and bear our burdens with patience and even joy. Yes, we ponder the Savior’s sufferings and feel their weight.</p><p>But we sometimes get stuck there—in the garden, at the cross, inside the tomb. We fail to move upwards to the joy of the tomb bursting open, the defeat of death, and Christ’s victory over all that prevents us from gaining peace and returning to our Heavenly Home. Whether we shed tears of sorrow or tears of gratitude during the sacrament, blessed be those tears.</p><p>Now, for parents of children who are young or have special needs, there is often no such thing as a time of stillness and quiet reflection during the sacrament. Joy is what you feel for and from the Savior as you constantly care for His little lambs. No effort in this pursuit is wasted, and God is so aware of you. Likewise, at home, we can begin to enhance our hopes and expectations for our time at church. In family councils, we can discuss how each individual can contribute in meaningful ways to welcoming all to the Church of Joy. Plan and expect to have a joyful experience at church.</p><p>The ward council can envision and create a culture of joy-filled reverence for our sacrament meetings, identifying practical steps and visual cues to help. Joy looks different for different people. For some, it may be exuberant greetings at the door; for others, it might be quietly helping people feel comfortable by smiling and sitting next to them with a kind and open heart. For those who feel left out or on the margins, the warmth of this welcome will be crucial. Ultimately, we can ask ourselves how the Savior would want our sacrament meeting to be. How would He want each one of His children to be welcomed, cared for, nourished, and loved?</p><p>How would He want us to feel when we come to be renewed through remembering Him? At the start of my journey of faith, joy in Jesus Christ was my first great discovery, and it changed my world. If you have yet to discover His joy, embark on its quest. This is an invitation to receive the Savior’s gift of peace, light, and joy—to revel in it, to wonder at it, and to rejoice in it every Sabbath. In the Book of Mormon, Alma expressed the feelings of my heart when he said, 'Now have we not reason to rejoice? Yea, I say unto you, there never was a people that had so great reason to rejoice as we, since the world began. Yea, and my joy is carried away, even unto boasting in my God, for He has all power, all wisdom,</p><p>And all understanding. He comprehendeth all things, and He is a merciful being,</p><p>Even unto salvation, to those who repent and believe on His name. Now if this is boasting, so will I boast, for this is my joy, my life, my light, and my great thanksgiving. Welcome to the Church of Joy. In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p></div> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-svelte-h="svelte-tyn8xv"><i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i></button></div></div> </div></div> </div></div> </div><div class="accordion" id="mfa2cbya08v0oj176io1-4"><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapse-mfa2cbya08v0oj176io1-4" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapse-mfa2cbya08v0oj176io1-4"><span>Elder David L.

Buckner"> <div><h2>Ye Are My Friends</h2> <strong>Elder David L. Buckner</strong> <br><small>General Authority Seventy</small></div></div>        <div class="d-flex gap-3"><div><p>Contention and division have replaced simple discourse with judgment and scorn, and friendships are divided by isms and heights. I have come to know that there is a clear, simple, and divine example we can look to for unity, love, and belonging. That example is Jesus Christ. I testify that He is the great unifier. In December of 1832, as appearances of troubles among the nations were becoming more visible than at any time since the organization of the Church, Latter-day Saint leaders in Kirtland, Ohio, gathered for a conference. They prayed separately and vocally to the Lord to reveal His will unto them.</p><p>In acknowledgment of the prayers of these faithful members during times of intense trouble, the Lord comforted them, addressing the Saints three times with the two powerful words: 'My friends.' Jesus Christ has long called His faithful followers His friends. Fourteen times in the Doctrine and Covenants, the Savior uses the term 'friend' to define a sacred and cherished relationship. Now, I’m not talking about the word 'friend' as the world defines it—subject to social media followers or likes. Friendship cannot be captured in a hashtag or a number on Instagram or X. Admittedly, as a teenager, I remember dreaded conversations when I heard these painful words, 'Hey, can we just be friends?'</p><p>'Let’s just stay in the friend zone.' Nowhere in holy writ do we hear Him say, 'Ye are just My friends.' Rather, He taught that 'greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.' 'Ye are they whom my Father hath given me. Ye are my friends.' The sentiment is clear. The Savior numbers each of us and watches over us. This watch care is not trivial or insignificant. Rather, it is exalting, elevating, and eternal. I see the Savior's declaration 'Ye are my friends' as a clarion call to build higher and holier relationships among all of God's children, that we may be one.</p><p>We do this as we come together, seeking both opportunities to unite in a sense of belonging for all. The Savior beautifully demonstrated this in His call to 'come, follow me.' He drew upon the gifts and individual attributes of a diverse group of followers to call His apostles. He called fishermen, zealots, brothers known for their thunderous personalities, and even a tax collector. Their belief in the Savior and their desire to draw unto Him united them. They looked to Him, saw God through Him, and straightway left their nets and followed Him. By doing so, they demonstrated how building higher and holier relationships brings us together as one.</p><p>My wife, Jennifer, and I were blessed to raise our five children in New York City. There, in that busy metropolis, we forged precious and sacred relationships with neighbors, school friends, business associates, faith leaders, and fellow Latter-day Saints. In May of 2020, just as the world was grappling with the spread of the global pandemic, members of the New York City Commission of Religious Leaders met virtually in an abruptly called meeting. There was no agenda, no special guest, just a request to come together and discuss the challenges we were all facing as faith leaders. The Centers for Disease Control had just reported that our city was the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.</p><p>For these religious leaders, the removal of personal ministries, congregational gatherings, and weekly worship was a devastating blow. Our small group, which included a cardinal, reverend, rabbi, imam, pastor, monsignor, and an elder, listened, consoled, and supported one another. Instead of focusing on our differences, we saw what we had in common. We spoke of possibilities and improbabilities. We rallied and responded to questions about faith and the future. And then we prayed. Oh, how we prayed! In a richly diverse setting, filled with complexity and colliding cultures,</p><p>We saw our differences dissipate as we came together as friends with one voice, one purpose, and one prayer. No longer were we looking across the table at each other, but heavenward with each other. We left each subsequent meeting more united and ready to pick ourselves up and go to work. The collaboration that resulted and the service rendered to thousands of New Yorkers taught me that in a world calling for division, distance, and disengagement, there is always much more that unites us than divides us. The Savior pled, 'Be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine.' Brothers and sisters,</p><p>We must stop looking for reasons to divide and seek opportunities to be one. He has blessed us with unique gifts and attributes that invite learning from one another and personal growth. I have taught my university students that 'if I do what you do and you do what I do, we don’t need each other. But because you don’t do what I do, and I don’t do what you do, we do need each other. And that need brings us together.' To divide and conquer is the adversary’s plan to destroy friendships, families, and faith. It is the Savior’s plan to unite.</p><p>One of the promised blessings of becoming one is a powerful sense of belonging. Elder Whitney M. Cook taught that the essence of truly belonging is to be one in Christ. On a recent visit with my family to the West African country of Ghana, I was enchanted with a local custom. Upon arriving at a church or a home, we were greeted with the words 'You are welcome.' When food was served, our host would announce, 'You are invited.' These simple greetings were extended with purpose and intentionality. 'You are welcome.' 'You are invited.' We place similar sacred declarations on our meetinghouse doors.</p><p>But the sign 'Visitors Welcome' is not enough. Do we warmly welcome all who come through the doors? Brothers and sisters, it is not enough to just sit in the pews. We must heed the Savior’s call to build higher and holier relationships with all of God’s children. We must live our faith. My father often reminded me that 'simply sitting in a pew on Sunday doesn’t make you a good Christian any more than sleeping in a garage makes you a car.' We must live our lives so that the world does not see us but sees Him through us. This does not take place only on Sundays.</p><p>It takes place at the grocery store, the gas pump, the school meeting, the neighborhood gathering—all places where baptized and unbaptized members of our family gather. Our worship on Sunday is a reminder that we need each other, and together we need Him. Our unique gifts and talents that differentiate us in a secular world unite us in a sacred space. The Savior has called upon us to help one another, lift one another, and edify each other. This is what He did when He healed the woman with an issue of blood, when the leper cried for His mercy, counseled the young prince who asked what more he could do, loved Nicodemus who knew,</p><p>But faltered in his faith, and sat with the woman at the well, who did not fit the custom of the day. We need to stop discussing our divisions. This, to me, is church—a place of gathering, recovery, repair, and refocus. As President Nelson has taught, 'The gospel net is the largest net in the world. God has invited all to come unto Him. There is room for everyone.' Some may have had experiences that make them feel they do not belong. The Savior’s message to you and to them is merciful: 'Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.'</p><p>The gospel of Jesus Christ is the perfect place for us. Coming to church offers the hope of better days, the promise that you are not alone, and a family who needs us as much as we need them. Elder D. Todd Christofferson affirms that being one with the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is, without doubt, the ultimate belonging. To any who have stepped away and are seeking a chance to return, I offer an eternal truth and invitation: You belong. Come back. It is time. In a contentious and divided world, I testify that the Savior, Jesus Christ, is the way.</p><p>May I invite each of us to be worthy of the Savior’s invitation to His people and to boldly declare, as He did, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p></div> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-svelte-h="svelte-tyn8xv"><i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i></button></div></div> </div></div> </div></div> </div><div class="accordion" id="mfa2cbya08v0oj176io1-5"><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapse-mfa2cbya08v0oj176io1-5" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapse-mfa2cbya08v0oj176io1-5"><span>Elder D.

Martin Goury"> <div><h2>Be Thou Clean</h2> <strong>Elder D. Martin Goury</strong> <br><small>General Authority Seventy</small></div></div>        <div class="d-flex gap-3"><div><p>When I was about five years old, I was playing football with my friends behind the church in my small village in Ottawa. I immediately remembered the preacher's call to his congregation to cleanse their clothes in preparation for the Savior's imminent arrival. I ran home as fast as I could, asking my little Caribbean mother to clean my few clothes so that I could be spotless and ready for the Savior's coming the next day. Although my mother was skeptical about the Savior's imminent return, she still washed my first outfit. The next morning, I put on the still-slightly-damp clothing and eagerly waited for the announcement of the Savior's arrival.</p><p>As the day wore on and evening came, I decided to go to the meeting house. I was deeply disappointed to find the church empty, and the Savior had not arrived. You can imagine my feelings of disappointment. Years later, as I was receiving the missionary lessons in preparation to join the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I read the following: 'Therefore, nothing entereth into his rest save it be those who have washed their garments in my blood, because of their faith and the repentance of all their sins, and their faithfulness unto the end.'</p><p>The clarification I received at that time helped me understand the important truths that had eluded my young mind many years earlier. The previous message was centered on the importance of spiritual purity. It urged the congregation to seek repentance, make changes in their lives, and turn to the Savior for redemption. Though I had not fully understood the inevitability of stains in our lives, I am deeply thankful that our Heavenly Father provided a Savior to atone for our transgressions. Through the Savior’s redemptive sacrifice, each of us can repent, seek forgiveness, and become clean.</p><p>Repentance, a foundational principle of the gospel, is essential for our spiritual development and resilience as we navigate life’s challenges. During the April 2022 General Conference, President Russell M. Nelson invited every member of the Church to experience the joy of daily repentance. He said: 'Please do not fear or delay repenting. Satan delights in your misery. Cut it short. Cast his influence out of your life.' Start today to experience the joy of putting off the natural man. The Savior loves us always, but especially when we repent. If you feel you have strayed too far from the covenant path for too long and have no way to return, that simply is not true.</p><p>If there is something that you have not fully repented of, I encourage you to heed President Nelson’s call not to procrastinate your repentance. It may require some courage to engage in this process. However, I can assure you that the joy that comes from sincere repentance surpasses understanding. Through repentance, our burdens are lifted and replaced with a sense of peace and tranquility. As we repent daily, we are sanctified by the Savior’s love, increasing our ability to feel the promptings and influence of the Holy Ghost.</p><p>My eternal companion was born with a hearing impairment and, as a result, must wear hearing aids. Dust and sweat can affect the performance of these devices. This morning, I observed her diligently cleaning the connecting tubes before wearing the aids. This routine eliminates any debris, moisture, or condensation, thereby improving her ability to hear and communicate effectively. Without this daily maintenance, her ability to be of service throughout the day diminishes, and spoken words gradually fade and eventually become inaudible. Just as daily hearing aid cleaning allows her to hear clearly, daily repentance allows us to discern the guidance of the Lord through the Holy Ghost.</p><p>Near the end of the Lord’s mortal ministry, and before His departure to the Garden of Gethsemane, He prepared His disciples to face the upcoming trials. He instructed them, saying: 'The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.' One of the Holy Ghost’s essential functions is to teach, lead, and guide every individual who listens to that still, small voice.</p><p>Just as clogged tubes in a hearing aid can hinder proper functionality, our spiritual connection with our Heavenly Father can also be impaired, leading to dangerous misconceptions or a failure to respond to promptings. In today’s world, where information is more accessible than ever before, we may be tempted to turn to worldly sources for guidance rather than God. President Russell M. Nelson taught: 'In coming days, it will not be possible to survive spiritually without the guiding, directing, comforting, and constant influence of the Holy Ghost.'</p><p>Though each of us can receive the gift of the Holy Ghost at the time of our confirmation, the blessings of the Holy Ghost are conditioned upon our worthiness. The Spirit of the Lord does not dwell in unholy temples. When we strive to follow the guidance of the prophets and apostles, our capacity to have the Holy Ghost as a constant companion grows. The Holy Ghost provides clarity, inspiration, and impressions that align with our eternal purpose and prepare us for spiritual growth.</p><p>I was recently assigned to preside over a stake conference in the Salt Lake City West Stake in Utah. During this event, I met with the stake president, who had developed his ability to discern the promptings of the Holy Ghost through righteous living and daily repentance. As part of our ministering effort, we coordinated visits to three households. Upon completing our final visit, we found ourselves with approximately 30 minutes remaining before our next engagement. As we traveled back to the stake center, President Chestnut received an impression to visit one additional family. We both agreed to follow this prompting.</p><p>We proceeded to visit the Jones family, where we discovered a young disciple who was bedridden due to illness, with her parents by her side. With their permission, we administered to her. As we prepared to depart, Sister Jones asked how we knew of her urgent need for a blessing. The truth is, we did not know. However, our Heavenly Father was aware of her need and inspired President Chestnut to visit their home. When we are more in tune with the Spirit, we are better able to minister effectively to those in need, as Jesus Christ would have us do.</p><p>I know that the ministry of Jesus Christ is real and that as we learn to follow the guidance of the Holy Ghost, He will lead us to repentance and give us the power of the Savior’s Atonement in our lives. I testify that President Russell M. Nelson is the Lord’s living prophet on the earth today. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p></div> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-svelte-h="svelte-tyn8xv"><i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i></button></div></div> </div></div> </div></div> </div><div class="accordion" id="mfa2cbya08v0oj176io1-6"><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapse-mfa2cbya08v0oj176io1-6" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapse-mfa2cbya08v0oj176io1-6"><span>Elder Aroldo B.

Each of them had been forgotten by society. During the interviews, they discovered several crimes that had been committed against the elderly, such as abandonment, mistreatment, and misappropriation of funds.</p><p>A key pillar of this law society is to care for the poor and the needy. Just two months later, the prosecutors successfully brought charges against the responsible parties. This imperfect example of service reminds me of the law of consecration and the service of God. One heartwarming personal interview during the process was with a kind-hearted 93-year-old woman who was deeply grateful for our service.</p><p>She jokingly exclaimed, 'Marry me, surprise prosecutor over there!

The nursing home residents knew that regardless of their worldly anonymity, they were known personally by a loving Heavenly Father.</p><p>Through their faith in Christ, they understood that God's mercy would provide for them. Just as the Jaredites faced their trials with faith and eventually reached the promised land, we can also help others progress in their journey to receive God's blessings. We can decide to serve as instruments in the Lord's hands to never cease guiding others toward their promised land.</p><p>Several years ago, my dear wife and I were interviewed for a new church calling. Our stake president asked me to pray and carefully consider names to recommend as counselors. When I suggested one name, the stake president hesitated, questioning whether this brother was the right choice. He didn’t have a car to visit members, and he always wore sunglasses at church.</p><p>Despite these concerns, I felt strongly that I should still recommend him as my counselor, and the stake president supported the recommendation. I was sustained in the calling. To my surprise, this brother proved to be an exceptional counselor, serving faithfully and humbly.</p><p>One day, while discussing his habit of wearing sunglasses in church, I asked, 'Brother, do you have problems with your vision? Why do you wear sunglasses in church?' He replied that he wore them out of habit. I lovingly told him, 'The members need to see your eyes, and you must be able to see them better too.' From that day forward, he never wore sunglasses in church again.</p><p>This beloved brother served by my side until I was released as bishop. He is still serving faithfully and is an example of dedication and commitment to the Lord Jesus Christ. Yet, he was once an unknown 'sunglasses wearer,' sitting seemingly forgotten in the pews of the church.</p><p>Whether we are nursing home residents, unknown sunglasses wearers, or anyone else facing trials, the Savior can consecrate our afflictions for our gain and help us progress spiritually. He does this whether or not we are recognized by others.</p><p>Prophets, such as President Russell M. Nelson, have extended the call to young men and women to serve missions. This missionary service is a priesthood responsibility, and the invitation applies to all who are able. President Nelson has said that today’s generation has the potential to have more impact in the world than any previous generation.</p><p>Of course, this doesn’t mean that we will be perfect the moment we enter the missionary training center. It might feel like stepping into the unknown, much like Nephi being led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which he should do. Like Jeremiah, some may feel inadequate and say, 'I cannot speak, for I am a child.'</p><p>Even Moses felt unsure, saying, 'O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant.' Yet, the Lord reassured Moses and Jeremiah with the promise that He would be with them, guiding their words and actions.</p><p>Spiritual growth happens line upon line, precept upon precept. As you earnestly strive to serve Jesus Christ in the mission field through faith, repentance, obedience, and hard work, you will become instruments in the hands of the Lord.</p><p>Sometimes we may feel unrecognized or forgotten. However, you must know that you have a perfect Heavenly Father who knows you personally and a Savior who loves you. Missionary leaders, despite their imperfections, will serve as winds that never cease to blow, guiding you along your journey of personal conversion toward your promised land.</p><p>Serving on a mission will help you grow spiritually and become a lifelong disciple of Jesus Christ. As you progress on your journey, remember that you are never forgotten. The Savior has taught that no one is ever forgotten.</p><p>On the contrary, He exemplified how to minister to the one in every moment of His earthly ministry. Even in the face of opposition and trials, we must trust that the winds of the Lord will never cease to blow us toward our promised land.</p><p>Each of us can be part of this divine effort to help others on their journey to their own promised land. I testify that Jesus Christ is our advocate with the Father.</p></div> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-svelte-h="svelte-tyn8xv"><i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i></button></div></div> </div></div> </div></div> </div><div class="accordion" id="mfa2cbya08v0oj176io1-7"><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapse-mfa2cbya08v0oj176io1-7" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapse-mfa2cbya08v0oj176io1-7"><span>Elder Ulisses Soares <br> <small>Aligning Our Witll with His</small></span> </button></h2> <div id="flush-collapse-mfa2cbya08v0oj176io1-7" class="accordion-collapse multi-collapse-mfa2cbya08v0oj176io1 collapse" data-bs-parent="#mfa2cbya08v0oj176io1-7"><div class="accordion-body"><div class="d-flex flex-column gap-3"><div class="d-flex flex-row justify-content-start align-items-end gap-3"><img class="speaker-image svelte-1l0ikvw" src="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/f28b995aa6a45c898f714de5ba6c6da8bf161559/full/!320%2C384/0/default" alt="Speaker Image Elder Ulisses Soares"> <div><h2>Aligning Our Witll with His</h2> <strong>Elder Ulisses Soares</strong> <br><small>Quorum of the Twelve Apostles</small></div></div>        <div class="d-flex gap-3"><div><p>On a certain occasion, the Savior spoke of a merchant man who was searching for goodly pearls. During the merchant man's search, he found one of great price. However, in order to acquire the magnificent pearl, this man had to sell all his possessions, which he completely and joyfully did. Through this short and thoughtful parable, the Savior beautifully taught that the Kingdom of Heaven is likened.</p><p>And to a priceless pearl, truly the most precious treasure, that should be desired over all else. The fact that the merchant instantly sold all his possessions to obtain that valuable pearl clearly indicates that we should align our minds and desires with the will of the Lord and willingly do everything we can during our mortal journey to attain the eternal blessings of God's kingdom.</p><p>To be people worthy of this great reward, we certainly need, among other things, to give our best effort to set aside all self-centered pursuits and abandon any entanglement that holds us back from full commitment to the Lord and His higher and holier ways. The Apostle Paul refers to this sanctifying pursuit as 'having the mind of Christ.' As exemplified by Jesus Christ, this means doing all those things that please the Lord. In our lives, or as some people say nowadays, 'doing what works for the Lord.'</p><p>In our gospel sense, doing always those things that please the Lord relates to melding our will to His will. The Savior poignantly taught the importance of this principle while instructing His disciples: 'For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. And this is the will of him that sent me, that everyone which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.'</p><p>The Savior achieved a perfect and divine level of submission to the Father by allowing His will to be swallowed up in the Father's will.</p><p>He said, 'And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.'</p><p>In teaching the Prophet Joseph Smith about the anguish and agonies of the Atonement, the Savior said, 'Behold, I, God, have suffered these things for all, that they might not suffer if they would repent; which suffering caused myself, even God, the greatest of all, to tremble because of pain, and to bleed at every pore, and to suffer both body and spirit—and would that I might not drink the bitter cup, and shrink—nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men.'</p><p>During our sojourn in mortality, we often wrestle with what we think we know, what we think is best, and what we assume works for us, as opposed to what Heavenly Father actually knows is eternally best and what absolutely works for His children within His plan. This great wrestle can become very complex, especially considering the prophecies contained in the scriptures for our day.</p><p>'This know also, that in the last days men shall be lovers of their own selves, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.' One sign that indicates fulfillment of this prophecy is the current growing trend in the world, adopted by so many, of people becoming concerned with themselves and constantly proclaiming, 'No matter what, I live my own truth,' or 'I do what works for me.' As Paul the Apostle said, 'They seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.'</p><p>This way of thinking is often justified as being authentic by those who indulge in self-centered pursuits, personal preferences, or who want to justify certain types of behavior that frequently don't match God's loving plan and His will. If we let our hearts and minds embrace this way of thinking, we can create significant stumbling blocks for ourselves in acquiring the most priceless pearl that God has lovingly prepared for His children: eternal life.</p><p>While it is true that each of us travels an individualized discipleship journey on the covenant path, striving to keep our hearts and minds centered on Jesus Christ, we need to be careful and constantly vigilant not to be tempted to adopt this type of worldly philosophy in our lives.</p><p>Instead, let us sincerely embrace a Christlike life as our more important goal than simply being 'authentic.' Dear friends, when we choose to let God be the most powerful influence in our lives, over our self-serving pursuits, we can make progress in our discipleship and increase our capacity to unite our minds and hearts with the Savior's.</p><p>On the other hand, when we don't allow God's way to prevail in our lives, we are left to ourselves. And when we doubt the Lord's inspiring guidance, we can justify almost anything we do or don't do. We can also make excuses for ourselves by doing things our own way, saying, in effect, 'I'm just doing things my way.'</p><p>On one occasion, while the Savior was declaring His doctrine, some people, particularly the self-righteous Pharisees, rejected His message and boldly declared that they were children of Abraham, implying that their lineage would grant them special privileges in the sight of God. That mentality led them to lean unto their own understanding and to disbelieve what the Savior was teaching.</p><p>The Pharisees' reaction to Jesus was clear evidence that their presumptuous attitude left no place in their hearts for the Savior's words and God's way. In response, Jesus wisely and courageously declared that if they were true covenant children of Israel, they would do the works of Abraham, especially considering that the God of Abraham was standing before them and teaching them the truth at that very moment.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, as you can see, acting on this mentality of 'what works for me' versus 'what pleases the Lord' is not a new trend that is unique to our day. It is an age-old mentality that has crossed the centuries and often blinds the wise in their own eyes and confuses many of God's children. This mentality is, in fact, an old trick of the adversary. It is a deceptive path that carefully leads God's children away from the true and faithful covenant path.</p><p>While personal circumstances, such as genetics, geography, and physical and mental challenges, do influence our journey, in things that really matter, there is an inner space where we are free to choose whether or not we will follow the pattern the Lord has prepared for us.</p><p>He marked the path and led the way. At every point, as disciples of Christ, our desire should be to do His will in all things that please Him. As we strive to be true to every covenant we have entered into and live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God, we will be protected against falling into the sins and errors of the world, the errors of philosophy and doctrine that would lead us away from the most precious pearls.</p><p>I have been personally inspired by how such spiritual submissiveness to God has impacted the lives of faithful disciples of Christ as they choose to do those things that work for and are pleasing in the sight of the Lord.</p><p>I know a young man who, instead of going on a mission, was inspired to serve the Lord after listening to a senior leader of the Church share his personal testimony and sacred experiences as a missionary. In his own words, this young man, now a returned missionary, said, 'As I listened to the testimony and experiences of Jesus Christ, I was able to feel God's love, and I desired to share that love with others. At that very moment, I knew that I should serve a mission, despite my fears, doubts, and concerns. I chose to fully trust in the blessings and promises of God for His children.'</p><p>Today, I am a new person. I have a testimony that this gospel is true. The Church of Jesus Christ has been restored on the Earth.</p><p>This young man chose the Lord's way and became an example of a true disciple in every aspect. I know of a young woman who decided not to compromise her standards when she was asked to dress immodestly to fit into the business division of the fashion company where she worked. Understanding that her body is a sacred gift from our Heavenly Father and a place where the Spirit can dwell, she was moved to live by a standard higher than the world's.</p><p>She not only gained the confidence of those who saw her living by the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ, but she also preserved her job, which, for a moment, was in jeopardy. Her willingness to do what was pleasing in the sight of the Lord, rather than what worked for the world, gave her confidence in making difficult choices.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we are constantly confronted by similar decisions in our daily church and personal lives. It takes courage and a willing heart to pause and pursue an honest introspection to acknowledge the presence of weaknesses in our lives and to submit ourselves to God, ultimately choosing His way rather than our own.</p><p>The ultimate test of our discipleship is found in our willingness to give up and lose our own selves and submit our hearts and wills to God so that His will may be done. The most glorious fruits of our mortality are discovered when we find the joy that comes when doing always those things that work for and please the Lord.</p><p>When what works for Him becomes one and the same with what works for us, to decisively and unquestionably make the Lord's will our own requires majestic energy and dedication. In that sublime moment, we become consecrated to the work, and we totally yield our ways to Him.</p><p>Such spiritual submissiveness is beautiful, powerful, and transformative. I testify to you that allowing the Lord's will to prevail in our lives will enable us to find the most precious pearl in the world—the Kingdom of Heaven.</p><p>That is my prayer, that each of us, in our time and turn, will be able to declare with covenant confidence to our Heavenly Father and Savior, Jesus Christ, that 'what works for Thee works for me.' I say this in the sacred name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p></div> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-svelte-h="svelte-tyn8xv"><i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i></button></div></div> </div></div> </div></div> </div> <div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center"><h2 class="h2">Evening Session</h2> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target=".multi-collapse-o23lnomnkva4ia3kdszy" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="multiCollapseExample1 multiCollapseExample2">Toggle All</button></div></div> <div class="accordion" id="o23lnomnkva4ia3kdszy-0"><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapse-o23lnomnkva4ia3kdszy-0" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapse-o23lnomnkva4ia3kdszy-0"><span>Elder Gerrit W.

Gong</strong> <br><small>Quorum of the Twelve Apostles</small></div></div>        <div class="d-flex gap-3"><div><p>Our recent gong family reunion included a fun talent show, complete with a dad jokes contest. But this contest was unusual. On one team was Grandpa Nee and two of the grandchildren, ages 12 and 11. On the other team was an artificial intelligence (AI) program. Oh yeah, prompted by a cousin to tell dad jokes in the style of Garrett W. Gong. Grandpa Garrett Gong versus AI Garikov. The grandchildren and I went first. 'What do you call a dinosaur who crashes his car?' Tyrannosaurus wrecks! Erikom was instructed. Inclined, Erik W. Gong, Apocla, Kim. Care of quote. And I said, Dow Jones, who has spoken about</p><p>His warm thoughtful and uplifting style because he was rooted in love and reached out the branches of kindness. Like that tree, we too can find strength in our roots and joy extending kindness to those in need. What do you think? Nope. That's where the clock all around us for opportunities to act with grateful eyes and hearts is the gospel of joy and holiness in everyday life. Holiness sets things apart to sanctify at first. But holiness also invites us to see the sacred amidst this world's messiness. People's duty to walk with the Lord at home.</p><p>My sister Robin and I meet church members and friends. In many places and circumstances, there are stories of the holiness to the Lord in everyday acts and smiles. All around this way, this communion with God, community and compassion with each other, commit and covenant with God, family, and friends centered in Jesus Christ. Growing evidence highlights the striking fact: religious believers are, on average, happier, healthier, and more resilient than those without spiritual commitment or connection. Happiness in life is not detached from mental and chemical health, meaning, and purpose. Character refinement, close relationships, teams—even financial and material stability—on each dimension, active religious practitioners flourish. They are joined by physical and mental health and greater life satisfaction across all ages and demographic groups.</p><p>Countries where religious structure and stability offer clarity, purpose, and inspiration amidst life's twists and turns, flourish. The household of faith and community of saints combat isolation and the lonely crowd. Holiness to the Lord says no to the profane, no to sarcasm or cleverness at others' expense, no to algorithms that monetize anger or polarization. Holiness to the Lord says yes to the sacred, to reverence, and to becoming our purest, happiest, and most authentic selves as we follow Him in faith. What does holiness to the Lord in everyday life look like? Holiness to the Lord in everyday life looks like two faithful young adults, married for a year, sharing an open testimony of vulnerability, gospel covenants, sacrifice, and service in their unfolding lives.</p><p>He begins, 'In high school, I was in a dark place. I felt like God wasn't there for me. One night, a friend said, 'Hey, have you read Alma 36 ever?' As I started reading, she said, I was overcome with peace and love. I felt like I was being given this big hug. When I read on, in verse 12, I knew Heavenly Father saw me and knew exactly how I was feeling.' She continues, 'Before we got married, I was honest with my fiancé. He had a great testimony of tithing. I asked, why did God want us to give money when others had so much?' Together, we figured it out. He challenged me to start paying tithing. I really saw my testimony grow on the ground.' She said, 'Sometimes, money was tight, but we saw so many blessings, and somehow, three checks came in.'</p><p>In my nursing class, she said, 'I was the only member of the church and the only one married. Many times, I left class frustrated or crying because I felt classmates singling me out with negative comments about my beliefs, my choices, or even my marriage.' Yet she continued, 'This past semester, I learned how to better voice my beliefs and be a good gospel example. My knowledge and testimony grew because I was tested in my ability to stand alone and be strong in what I believe in.' Her husband added, 'Before my mission, I had offers to play college baseball. Making a difficult decision, I put one of those offers aside and went to serve. I wouldn’t trade those two years for anything. When I returned home, I expected a difficult transition, but it was harder than when I left.'</p><p>He continues, 'I had more offers to play baseball again, and most importantly, I learned to rely upon the Lord more than ever. As a missionary, I taught that Heavenly Father promises us power in ordinances, but sometimes I forgot that for myself.' Their treasury of missionary holiness, the Lord blesses us with rich, full lives. Finances, timing, and other circumstances are often not easy, but when missionaries of all ages and backgrounds consecrate themselves to the Lord, things can work out in the Lord's timely way. A 48-year perspective, the senior missionary said, 'My dad wanted me to get a college education, not go on a mission.' Shortly after that, he had a heart attack and passed at age 47. How could I make things right with my father?</p><p>'Later,' he continues, 'after I decided to serve a mission, I saw my father in a dream. He was peaceful and content. He was happy I went.' The senior missionary continues, 'As Doctrine and Covenants Section 138 teaches, I believe my father could serve his mission in the spirit world. I picture my father helping our great-grandfather, who left Germany at age 17, lost to the family and found again. Like that, among the five brothers in my husband’s family, the four who served missions are the ones who finished college and became economists and leaders.' Holiness to the Lord in everyday life looks like a returned missionary who learned to let God prevail in his life. Earlier, he was asked to bless someone who was very sick. The missionary said, 'I gave a blessing of faith, praying for recovery.'</p><p>The young and newly ordained bishop said, 'In that moment, I learned to pray not for what I wanted, but for what the Lord knew the person needed.' I blessed the brother with peace and comfort. He later passed away peacefully in the arms of the Lord. Holiness to the Lord in everyday life looks like support reaching across the veil to connect, comfort, and strengthen. A university president said he feels guided by individuals he knows only by reputation, praying over his institution and its mission. My sister does her best every day after her husband was unfaithful to her and their children. I deeply admire her and others like her.</p><p>'One day, after folding laundry, hands on a stack of clothes, she sighed to herself, 'What's the point?' She felt a tender voice whisper, 'Your covenants are with me.'' For 50 years, another sister yearned for a relationship with her father. Growing up, she said, 'There were my brothers, my dear mother, and me—the only daughter. All I ever wanted was to be good enough for my dad. Then, my mom passed away. She was the only bridge between my father and me.' One day, the sister said, 'I heard a voice say, ‘Invite your dad and take him to the temple with you.' That was the beginning of a twice-a-month date with my daddy to the house of the Lord.'</p><p>'I told my dad I loved him. He told me he loved me too. Spending time in the house of the Lord healed us. My mother could not help us find that healing, but I believe she is working from the other side to help. My father and I completed ordinances for her, and the wholeness of our family was restored. The temple dedication was a great spiritual experience for me and my only daughter. Now we attend together and feel our love strengthened.' Holiness to the Lord in everyday life includes grieving when loved ones pass. Earlier this year, my dear mother gently slipped into the next life, days before her 90th birthday.</p><p>'If you asked my mother if she liked Rocky Road or white chocolate truffles, she would always say, 'Yes, please!' Who could say no to her? She loved all of life's flavors. I once asked her what her favorite decision had been. She said, 'Being baptized a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and choosing to remain one.' Now, as a 15-year-old, I was the only member in my large family to have covenant faith and trust in the Lord's truth.' His reflections on his mother continue: 'I've changed, his power sustained me, but I know my mother is not gone. She's just not here right now. Households bearing examples of everyday holiness point us to the Lord.'</p><p>Holiness to the Lord in everyday life includes coming more often to the Lord in His holy house. This is true when we are in the church or using our priesthood powers. My friends came to the Hanoka Island Temple open house. 'This is a place,' they said, 'that superheats your spirit.' I noticed that when I'm here, I want to be washed clean and ask forgiveness again. 'Can you feel the Spirit work out?'</p><p>With nine sacred words, our temples embody and proclaim, 'Holiness to the Lord.' Holiness to the Lord makes daily living sacred. It draws us closer and happier to the Lord and each other, and it prepares us to live with God, our Father, Jesus Christ, and our loved ones. You may wonder if your Heavenly Father loves you. The answer is an astounding absolute 'Yes.' We can feel His love as we make holiness to the Lord ours each day, happy and forever. I say this in the sacred name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p></div> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-svelte-h="svelte-tyn8xv"><i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i></button></div></div> </div></div> </div></div> </div><div class="accordion" id="o23lnomnkva4ia3kdszy-1"><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapse-o23lnomnkva4ia3kdszy-1" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapse-o23lnomnkva4ia3kdszy-1"><span>Sister Kristin M.

Where was I to begin, and where would I find the time? Even with my questions, I decided to move forward in faith, trusting that the Lord would help me. But I had to keep moving and moving in humility to Him.</p><p>I prayed, researched, sketched, and was blessed by help and resources. What began as a light canvas started to become something more. The process wasn’t easy. Sometimes it didn’t look as I hoped. Strokes and ideas changed, and many times I had to try again and again. And just when I thought the oil painting was finally complete...</p><p>I began to apply a transparent varnish to protect it from dirt and dust. As I did, I noticed that part of the paint started to smear and dissolve. I quickly realized that I had applied the varnish too soon. The painting was still wet, and I had wiped away a portion of it.</p><p>I was devastated, heartbroken. I had literally wiped away a portion of my painting with the varnish. Unsure of what to do, I felt sick. In a moment of desperation, I called my mother for comfort. She said, 'You can’t get back what was lost, but do the very best you can because you love it. That’s why you painted it.'</p><p>I worked through the night to repair the painting. The next morning, as I looked at it, I realized it looked better than before. How was that possible? What I thought was a mistake turned out to be an opportunity for the Lord’s merciful hand to mend what was broken. He was not done with the painting, just as He is not done with us.</p><p>What joy and relief filled my heart. I praised the Lord for His mercy. He not only saved the painting but taught me more about His love and power to save us from our weaknesses, mistakes, and sins and to help us become something more.</p><p>Just as the depth of my gratitude for the Savior has grown through this process, so has my personal love and gratitude for Jesus Christ. I know that working with Him on my weaknesses and seeking forgiveness of my mistakes is possible, and I am forever grateful that I can change. He has my heart, and I hope to do whatever He would have me do and become.</p><p>Repentance allows us to feel God’s love and to know His ways in ways we would never otherwise know. Like the woman who anointed the Savior’s feet, she loved Him much because she had been forgiven much. We can receive an ongoing remission of our sins as we sincerely repent. The redeeming power of Jesus Christ is one of the greatest blessings of our covenants.</p><p>I know that our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, is mighty to save. He is the Son of God, who atoned for the sins of the world, laid down His life, and took it up again. He holds the power of redemption and resurrection. He has made immortality possible for all, and eternal life for those who choose Him. Through His atonement, we can repent and be cleansed.</p><p>It is a miracle. He loves you and me in this way. He invites us: 'Return unto me and repent of your sins and be converted that I may heal you.' He can heal the waste places of your soul, the places left dry, harsh, and desolate by sin. He can make your wilderness like Eden.</p><p>Just as we cannot comprehend the agony of Christ’s suffering in Gethsemane and on the cross, we also cannot measure the depth of His divine forgiveness, mercy, and love. You may feel that it’s not possible to be redeemed, or that you are an exception to the Savior’s love and power. But the Savior descended below all things to lift you and bring you into His marvelous light.</p><p>Through His sufferings, He has provided a way for each of us to overcome our personal struggles and sins. He has all power to save every man who believes on His name and brings forth fruits of repentance. Just as painting the portrait required work and pleading for help, repentance requires effort, humility, and submission to God’s will.</p><p>Repentance includes exercising faith in Jesus Christ, offering a broken heart and contrite spirit, confessing and forsaking sin, restoring what we can, and striving to live righteously. To repent and change, we must first recognize our sins. A person doesn’t take medicine unless they realize they are sick. Likewise, we may resist looking at ourselves and seeing what needs healing.</p><p>It’s easy to defend ourselves from the things that might do us good. But let’s not defend ourselves against the love, mercy, and healing the Lord desires to bless us with. Let’s put down any weapons of war—pride, selfishness, fear, unrighteous judgment—that keep us from receiving His love and happiness. Repentance is the pathway to purity, and purity brings power.</p><p>Painting the Lord is not finished with us. When we make mistakes, when we falter, our need for healing is not a burden to Him but the very reason He came. 'I have come into the world to bring redemption,' He said, 'to save the world from sin.' His arm of mercy is extended toward all who come to Him.</p><p>Come unto Him, all who are weary, worn, and burdened. Take His yoke upon you, for He is gentle and lowly in heart. He knows your heart. He cares about what you care about, including those you love. The Savior can redeem what is lost, including broken relationships. He can restore what is fractured and give it new purpose.</p><p>If you are struggling with something you think you should have already overcome, be patient with yourself. Keep your covenants. Repent often. Seek help from your leaders if needed, and go to the house of the Lord as often as you can. Listen for His promptings. He will not abandon His covenant relationship with you.</p><p>In my life, there have been relationships I struggled with. I often felt like I was failing and wondered, 'Did I not fix this before?' I have learned that there is often more work to do, more healing that is needed. Elder D. Todd Christofferson taught that the Lord smiles on those who seek to come to Him worthily and work day by day to replace weakness with strength.</p><p>Real repentance—real change—takes persistent effort. But each day brings new opportunities because of Jesus Christ. Each day you and I can experience the joy of redemption and of being made whole. I know that our Father in Heaven and Jesus Christ love you. Jesus Christ is the Savior and Redeemer of all mankind. He lives, and through His atonement, the bands of sin and death have been broken forever. I testify of these things in His sacred name, Jesus Christ. Amen.</p></div> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-svelte-h="svelte-tyn8xv"><i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i></button></div></div> </div></div> </div></div> </div><div class="accordion" id="o23lnomnkva4ia3kdszy-2"><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapse-o23lnomnkva4ia3kdszy-2" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapse-o23lnomnkva4ia3kdszy-2"><span>Elder Kyle S.

McKay</strong> <br><small>General Authority Seventy</small></div></div>        <div class="d-flex gap-3"><div><p>This day and always is to testify of Jesus Christ. He is the Son of God, the Creator and Savior of the world. Our Deliverer and Redeemer. The fundamental principle of our religion is the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets concerning Jesus Christ. Today, I share with you my knowledge and testimony of the Savior as it has been strengthened and deepened by the life and teachings of one key Apostle.</p><p>Fourteen-year-old Joseph Smith knelt in a grove of trees and offered a sincere prayer, seeking forgiveness and direction. His prayer received the attention of the most powerful beings in the universe, including the Father and the Son. What we now call the First Vision marked the beginning of the restoration of all things in this last dispensation.</p><p>The experience was personal and preparatory. All Joseph wanted was forgiveness and direction, and the Lord gave him both. The instruction to join none of the churches was direct, but the words 'thy sins are forgiven thee' were redemptive. For all the beautiful truths we might learn from the First Vision, perhaps Joseph’s main takeaway was simply that he had found the testimony of James to be true: 'If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God.'</p><p>The real significance of the First Vision today is to know that it is the nature of God to give to those who lack wisdom. The God that revealed Himself to Joseph Smith in the sacred grove is a God who answers teenagers in times of trouble. Joseph’s experience in the grove gave him confidence to ask for forgiveness and direction for the rest of his life. His experience has also given me confidence to ask for forgiveness and direction for the rest of my life.</p><p>On September 21, 1823, Joseph earnestly prayed for forgiveness, confident that Heaven would respond again, just as it had three years earlier. The Lord sent an angel to instruct Joseph and inform him of an ancient record, which he would later translate by the gift and power of God.</p><p>Almost thirteen years later, Joseph and Oliver Cowdery were in solemn, silent prayer in the newly dedicated Kirtland Temple. We do not know what they prayed for, but their prayers likely included a plea for forgiveness. The Lord declared, 'You are clean before me.' In the months and years that followed, Joseph and Oliver would sin again and again, but in that moment, for that moment, they were made clean, preparing them for the Glorious restoration of priesthood keys that was about to take place.</p><p>Joseph’s life of regular repentance gives me confidence to come boldly unto the throne of grace, that I may obtain mercy. I have learned that Jesus Christ has a redeeming disposition. It is neither His mission nor His nature to condemn—He came to save.</p><p>As part of the promise of the restoration of all things, the Lord, through Joseph Smith, brought forth the Book of Mormon and other revelations that contain the fullness of His gospel. Vital truths were restored with clarity and completeness as Joseph repeatedly asked the Lord for direction.</p><p>Consider the following truths: the Father and the Son have bodies as tangible as man’s; Jesus took upon Himself not only our sins but also our sicknesses, afflictions, and infirmities; His atonement was so excruciating that it caused Him to bleed from every pore; we are saved by His grace after all we can do.</p><p>There are conditions to Christ’s mercy. As we come unto Christ, He will not only forgive our sins, but He will also change our very nature so that we have no more disposition to do evil. Christ commands His people to build temples, where He manifests Himself unto them and endows them with power from on high.</p><p>I testify that all these things are true and necessary. They represent only a fraction of the fullness that was restored by Jesus Christ through Joseph Smith in response to Joseph’s recurring requests for direction.</p><p>In 1842, Joseph wrote of amazing things that would come to pass in this last dispensation. He declared that during our day, 'The Heavenly Priesthood will unite with the earthly to bring about those great purposes.' Angels are united with us in one common cause to roll forth the kingdom of heaven.</p><p>The Heavenly Priesthood are not idle. To his friend Benjamin Johnson, Joseph said, 'If I die, I would not be far away from you, and if on the other side of the veil, I will still be working with you, with my power greatly increased, to roll forth this kingdom.'</p><p>On June 27, 1844, Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum were martyred. Joseph’s body was laid to rest, but his testimony continues to reverberate around the world and in my soul. His words, 'I had seen a vision, I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it,' still inspire. Joseph never claimed perfection, but there is no error in the revelations he taught.</p><p>The fundamental principle of our religion is the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets concerning Jesus Christ—that He died, was buried, rose again on the third day, and ascended into heaven. All other things are only appendages to these truths, which pertain to our religion.</p><p>Like John the Baptist, Joseph Smith was not the light, but he came to bear witness of the light, that all men through him might believe. I believe and know that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. I testify that God is our loving Father. I know this because the voice of the Lord has been revealed to me, as it has been to His Apostles and Prophets, beginning with Joseph Smith.</p><p>I testify that Joseph Smith was and is a prophet of God, a witness and servant of the Lord Jesus Christ. He was blessed to open the last dispensation, and we are blessed that he did. I stand with Joseph in faith and testify that the Lord stands with His servant Joseph. The restoration continues to grow through him. Joseph is not far from us, and on the other side of the veil, he is still working with us with his power greatly increased to roll forth this kingdom.</p><p>With joy and thanksgiving, I raise my voice in praise to the man who communed with Jehovah, and above all, praise to Jehovah who communed with that man. In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p></div> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-svelte-h="svelte-tyn8xv"><i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i></button></div></div> </div></div> </div></div> </div><div class="accordion" id="o23lnomnkva4ia3kdszy-3"><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapse-o23lnomnkva4ia3kdszy-3" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapse-o23lnomnkva4ia3kdszy-3"><span>Elder Jorge M.

I marvel that He will descend from His divine throne to rescue us, so proud is man that He should extend His great love into social life. Sufficient to all to redeem and to justify. As I heard those words, I thought that despite my weaknesses and flaws, the Lord blessed me to know that through His strength I can do all things. Or even a word in this is something which I wish many of us to understand, and I still feel it right now speaking to you.</p><p>Never be fine as a faithful and balanced servant of the Lord. At times, even His chosen servants feel weak and inadequate. He said, 'Notwithstanding the great goodness of the Lord in showing me His marvelous works, my heart exclaims, O wretched man that I am.' Yet, my heart rejoices because of the salvation and power of God. Joseph Smith prayed in the grove near his home to find truth, peace, and forgiveness.</p><p>He heard the Lord's angels, 'My son, thy sins are forgiven thee. Go thy way, walk in my statutes and keep my commandments. Behold, I am the Lord of glory.' This marked the start of Joseph's journey toward personal salvation. Through his continuous repentance, Joseph opened the door to the restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.</p><p>Remarkably, the experience of the Prophet Joseph Smith illustrates how feelings of weakness, imperfection, and inadequacy can help us recognize our fallen nature. If we are humble, they lead us to realize our dependence on Jesus Christ and His grace.</p><p>My friends, repentance brings joy. Sweet repentance is essential. Like Joseph and Nephi, we can turn to the Savior and find healing, hope, and power through Him.</p><p>In the Book of Mormon, another testament of Jesus Christ, you and I can find countless individuals who learn to come to Christ through sincere repentance. I would like to share an example of the tender mercy of the Lord.</p><p>In Puerto Rico, a sister in my hometown of Ponce was preparing to give a friend a gift, which included a copy of the Book of Mormon. She wrapped the gift and carried it to deliver. On the way, however, a thief grabbed her bag and ran away with the gift inside.</p><p>Later, she shared this experience in church, and her friends commented, 'Who knows, maybe this will be an opportunity to share the gospel.' A few days later, she received a letter from the thief. The man wrote, 'You will never know how sorry I am for attacking you. But because of it, my life has changed. The Book of Mormon has helped me. I cannot spend the money I took, and I am returning it to you. Your kindness stopped me from harming you. I know we will meet again, and you will recognize me, for I will be your brother in the gospel.'</p><p>The letter brought tears to her eyes. This thief found the Lord through the power of repentance. He sought forgiveness from her and from God, and he experienced the miraculous transformation that sincere repentance brings. This story shows that the Lord's infinite love and mercy can reach even the darkest of situations.</p><p>Through repentance, this man joined the fold, and the blessings of the Gospel and the sacred ordinances of the temple became his. Families, remember your responsibilities to serve in the Lord’s vineyard, including the sacred work in the temple.</p><p>As we regularly worship in the house of the Lord and strive to keep the sacred covenants we make there, our ability to experience a change of heart, mind, and soul will increase. President Russell M. Nelson has testified, 'Nothing will open the heavens more than temple service.'</p><p>My dear friends, do you feel inadequate? Do you doubt yourself? Perhaps you ask, 'Do I measure up? Is it too late for me? Why do I keep failing when I try my best?' Remember what Elder Gary E. Stevenson taught: Our Savior’s atonement is infinite and eternal. We all fall short, but no matter where we are or what we have done, there is no point of no return. The Savior is ready to lift us, to forgive us, and to help us find our way back.</p><p>Life is a journey of repentance and growth. Repenting each day, even when it’s hard, brings the best kind of joy. Let us not wait for our trials to become unbearable before turning to God. Let us not postpone the joy of repentance.</p><p>The doctrine of Christ is the way. There is no other way under heaven whereby men and women can be saved. The doctrine of Christ is the doctrine of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. It will change us if we are willing to embrace it.</p><p>As we turn to the Savior and allow His love and grace to transform us, our posterity will be blessed, and we will become more like Him. The Master Healer will guide us, cleanse us, and help us overcome the challenges of life.</p><p>I testify that God’s infinite power, through the atonement of Jesus Christ, can change our hearts and heal our souls. True repentance is a powerful and beautiful process that brings us closer to Him.</p><p>I testify that the Gospel has been restored through the Prophet Joseph Smith and that President Russell M. Nelson is God’s prophet today. Jesus Christ is our Savior, and He leads His church. I know these things are true. In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p></div> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-svelte-h="svelte-tyn8xv"><i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i></button></div></div> </div></div> </div></div> </div><div class="accordion" id="o23lnomnkva4ia3kdszy-4"><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapse-o23lnomnkva4ia3kdszy-4" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapse-o23lnomnkva4ia3kdszy-4"><span>Elder David A.

And watch this conference Center, filled three times for the first time since Coleman. Filled with devoted disciples of Jesus Christ. I commend you for your faithfulness.</p><p>I just happened to serve as the president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from November 1985 until May 1994. I was 33 years old when President Benson became the president of the church.</p><p>His teachings and testimony impacted me deeply at that stage of my life and in powerful ways. One of the hallmarks of President Benson’s ministry was his focus upon the importance of the Book of Mormon. He emphasized repeatedly that the Book of Mormon is the keystone of our religion, the keystone of our testimony, the keystone of our doctrine, and the keystone in the witness of the Savior.</p><p>He also often emphasized teachings and warnings about the sin of pride. In this latter-day testament of Jesus Christ, a particular teaching by President Benson greatly impacted me and continues to influence my study. He said, 'The Book of Mormon was written for our day. The Nephites never had the Book of Mormon, neither did the Lamanites of ancient times. It was meant for us.'</p><p>Mormon wrote near the end of the Nephite civilization under the inspiration of God, who sees all things from the beginning. Mormon abridged centuries of records, choosing the most important speeches and events that would be most helpful to us.</p><p>President Benson continued, 'Each of the major writers in the Book of Mormon testified that he wrote for future generations. If they saw our day and chose those things which would be of greatest worth to us, is that not how we should study the Book of Mormon? We should constantly ask ourselves, Why did the Lord inspire Mormon to include this account in his record? What lesson can I learn from this admonition to help me live in this day and age?'</p><p>President Benson's statements help us understand that the Book of Mormon is not primarily a historical record that looks to the past. Rather, this volume of scripture looks to the future and contains important principles, warnings, and lessons intended for the circumstances and challenges of our day.</p><p>The Book of Mormon is a book about our future and the times in which we now live and will yet live. I pray for the assistance of the Holy Ghost as we now consider relevant lessons for us today from the Book of Helaman in the Book of Mormon.</p><p>The record of Helaman and his sons describes a people who were anticipating the birth of Jesus Christ. The half-century recounted in this scriptural record highlights the conversion and righteousness of the Lamanites and the wickedness, apostasy, and abominations of the Nephites.</p><p>A series of comparisons and contrasts between Nephites and Lamanites from this ancient record are most instructive for us today. The Lamanites had become the more righteous people, in so much that their righteousness exceeded that of the Nephites because of their firmness and steadiness in the faith.</p><p>In contrast, there were many Nephites who had become hardened, impenitent, and grossly wicked, rejecting the word of God and the preaching of the prophets. The Nephites began to dwindle in unbelief and wickedness, while the Lamanites began to grow exceedingly in the knowledge of God, keeping His statutes and commandments and walking in truth and uprightness before Him.</p><p>The Spirit of the Lord began to withdraw from the Nephites because of the hardness of their hearts, while the Lord began to pour out His Spirit upon the Lamanites because of their easiness and willingness to believe in His word.</p><p>Perhaps the most stunning and sobering aspect of this decline into apostasy by the Nephites is the fact that all these iniquities came upon them in the space of not many years. How could a once-righteous people become so hardened and wicked in such a short period of time? How could they so quickly forget the God who had blessed them so abundantly?</p><p>In a powerful and profound way, the negative example of the Nephites teaches us today about the dangers of pride. Pride began to enter into the hearts of the people who professed to belong to the Church of God because of their exceedingly great riches and prosperity in the land.</p><p>They set their hearts upon riches and the vain things of this world. Because of that pride, which they suffered to enter into their hearts, they were lifted up beyond that which is good, because of their exceeding riches.</p><p>Ancient voices from the dust speak to us today. Prosperity, possessions, and ease constitute a potent mixture that can lead even the righteous to drink the spiritual poison of pride.</p><p>Allowing pride to enter into our hearts can cause us to mock that which is sacred, disbelieve in the spirit of prophecy and revelation, and set at naught the commandments of God. It can lead us to deny the word of God, cast out the prophets, and forget the Lord our God, refusing to follow Him.</p><p>Therefore, if we are not faithful and obedient, we can transform God-given blessings like prosperity into a prideful curse that diverts and distracts us from eternal truths and vital spiritual priorities.</p><p>We must always guard against a pride-induced exaggerated sense of self-importance, a misguided evaluation of our own self-sufficiency, and focusing on self instead of serving others. As we pridefully focus upon ourselves, we risk spiritual blindness.</p><p>Inasmuch as most, if not all, of this occurs internally and subtly, we cannot see the path of righteousness clearly if we are only focused on ourselves. Such spiritual blindness also causes us to turn away from righteousness and become lost.</p><p>The Lamanites symbolize this turning away from God by the Nephites. The Nephites sought happiness in doing iniquity, which is contrary to the nature of righteousness.</p><p>As Moroni observed, 'The more part of the people remained in their pride and wickedness, while the lesser part walked more circumspectly before God.'</p><p>In contrast to the Nephites' decline, the Lamanites turned to God and were brought to a knowledge of the truth by believing the teachings of the holy scriptures and prophets, exercising faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repenting of their sins, and experiencing a mighty change of heart.</p><p>As a consequence of their righteousness, the firmness and steadiness of the Lamanites in the faith exceeded that of the Nephites.</p><p>Moroni declared, 'The Lord has shown unto me great and marvelous things concerning that which must shortly come to pass.'</p><p>He spoke as though the people were present, although they were not, and said, 'Jesus Christ has shown you unto me, and I know your doings.'</p><p>Please remember that the Book of Mormon looks to the future and contains principles, warnings, and lessons intended for us in our day. Apostasy can occur at two levels: institutional and individual.</p><p>At the institutional level, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints will not be lost through apostasy or taken from the Earth. Joseph Smith declared, 'A standard of truth has been erected; no unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing. The truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independently, until it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear.'</p><p>At the individual level, however, each of us must beware of pride lest we become as the Nephites of old.</p><p>May I suggest that if you or I believe we are sufficiently strong to avoid pride, we may already be suffering from this deadly spiritual disease.</p><p>Simply stated, if you or I do not believe we could be afflicted with pride, we may already be in spiritual danger.</p><p>In the space of not many days, weeks, or months, we might forfeit our spiritual birthright for far less than a mess of pottage.</p><p>However, if you or I recognize pride, we will consistently do the small and simple things that will protect us and help us become as a child: submissive, meek, humble, patient, and full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon us.</p><p>Blessed are they who humble themselves without being compelled to be humble.</p><p>As we follow President Benson's counsel and ask ourselves why the Lord inspired Mormon to include in his abridgment of the Book of Helaman the accounts and events that he did, I am confident we will discern the applicability of these teachings to our individual lives and families today.</p><p>As we study and ponder this inspired record, we will be blessed with eyes to see, ears to hear, minds to comprehend, and hearts to understand the lessons we should learn to beware of pride, lest we should enter into temptation.</p><p>I joyfully witness that God the Eternal Father is our Father. Jesus Christ is His only begotten and beloved Son. He is our Savior.</p><p>I testify that as we walk in the meekness of the Lord's spirit, we will overcome pride and have peace in Him. I bear this witness in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p></div> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-svelte-h="svelte-tyn8xv"><i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i></button></div></div> </div></div> </div></div> </div> <h1 data-svelte-h="svelte-123h906">2024 General Conference Sunday</h1> <div class="d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center"><h2 class="h2">Morning Session</h2> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target=".multi-collapse-mfwvlps0pn9zeiwfjmt1" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="multiCollapseExample1 multiCollapseExample2">Toggle All</button></div></div> <div class="accordion" id="mfwvlps0pn9zeiwfjmt1-0"><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapse-mfwvlps0pn9zeiwfjmt1-0" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapse-mfwvlps0pn9zeiwfjmt1-0"><span>Elder Jeffery R Holland <br> <small>The Divine DNA of Jesus Christ</small></span> </button></h2> <div id="flush-collapse-mfwvlps0pn9zeiwfjmt1-0" class="accordion-collapse multi-collapse-mfwvlps0pn9zeiwfjmt1 collapse" data-bs-parent="#mfwvlps0pn9zeiwfjmt1-0"><div class="accordion-body"><div class="d-flex flex-column gap-3"><div class="d-flex flex-row justify-content-start align-items-end gap-3"><img class="speaker-image svelte-1l0ikvw" src="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/9799926c71ef33de86b343988888a4ea2a05a1a3/full/!320%2C384/0/default" alt="Speaker Image Elder Jeffery R Holland"> <div><h2>The Divine DNA of Jesus Christ</h2> <strong>Elder Jeffery R Holland</strong> <br><small>Quorum of the Twelve Apostles</small></div></div>        <div class="d-flex gap-3"><div><p>This is more to lie. A multitude had gathered. Including Roman soldiers. Learn the stage contract with sores. They were led by officers from the high priests who had torches in hand. This armed company was not off to conquer a city. Tonight, they were looking for only one man. A man not known to carry a weapon, receive military training, or engage in physical combat at any time in his entire life. As the soldiers approached, Jesus, in an effort to protect his disciples, stepped forth and said, 'Whom seek ye?' They replied, 'Jesus of Nazareth.' Jesus said, 'I am he.' As soon as he had said unto them, 'I am he,' they went backward and fell to the ground.</p><p>To me, that is one of the most stirring lines in all of Holy Scripture. Among other things, it tells me straightforwardly that just being in the presence of the Son of God—the great Jehovah of the Old Testament, the Good Shepherd of the New—who bore no weapon of any kind, just hearing his voice was enough to send antagonists stumbling into retreat, parting them into a jumble. Maybe the whole group wished they’d been assigned kitchen duty that night.</p><p>Just a few days earlier, when he entered the city triumphantly, all the city was moved. The scripture says, 'Who is this?' I can only imagine that 'Who is this?' was the question those muddled soldiers were now asking.</p><p>The answer to that question could not have been in his looks, for Isaiah prophesied some seven centuries earlier that he hath no form nor comeliness, and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. It certainly wasn’t in his polished wardrobe or his great personal wealth, of which he had neither. It could not have been from professional training in the local synagogues. We have no evidence that he ever studied at any of them.</p><p>Even in his youth, he could confound superbly prepared scribes and lawyers, astonishing them with his doctrine as one having authority. From that teaching in the temple to his triumphant entry into Jerusalem and his final unjustifiable arrest, Jesus was routinely placed in difficult, often devious situations in which he was always triumphant. Victories for which we have no explanation except his divine DNA.</p><p>Yet, down through history, many have simplified, even trivialized, our image of him and his witness of who he was. They’ve reduced his righteousness to mere traditionism, his justice to mere anger, his mercy to mere permissiveness. We must not be guilty of such simplistic versions that conveniently ignore teachings we find uncomfortable.</p><p>This dumbing down has been true even regarding his ultimate defining virtue—his love. During his mortal ministry, Jesus taught that there were two great commandments: love the Lord thy God and love thy neighbor. If we’re to follow the Savior faithfully in these two crucial and inexplicably linked rules, we ought to hold firmly to what he actually said. And what he actually said was, 'If ye love me, keep my commandments.'</p><p>On that same evening, he said we were to love one another as he had loved us. In those scriptures, those qualifying phrases defining true Christlike love—sometimes referred to as charity—are absolutely essential.</p><p>How did Jesus love? Well, first, he loved with all his heart, might, mind, and strength, giving him the ability to heal the deepest pain and declare the hardest reality. In short, he was one who could administer grace and insist on truth at the same time.</p><p>As Lehi blessed his son Jacob, 'Redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah, for he is full of grace and truth.' His love allowed an encouraging embrace when it was often needed and a bitter cup when occasionally it had to be swallowed.</p><p>So, we try to love with all of our heart, might, mind, and strength because that’s the way he loves us. Now, the second characteristic of Jesus’s divine charity was his obedience to every word that proceeded from God’s mouth, always aligning his will and behavior with that of his Heavenly Father.</p><p>When he arrived on this hemisphere following his resurrection, Christ said to the Nephites, 'Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I have drunk of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me and have suffered the will of the Father from the beginning.'</p><p>Of the myriad ways he could have introduced himself, Jesus did so by declaring his obedience to the will of the Father. Never mind that not long before this hour of greatest need, the only begotten Son of God had felt totally abandoned by his Father. Christ's charity, evident in complete loyalty to his divine will, persisted and continues to persist, not just through the easy and comfortable days but especially through the darkest and most difficult ones.</p><p>Jesus was a man of sorrows, the scriptures say, experiencing sadness, fatigue, disappointment, and excruciating pain. And in these and in all times, Jesus’s love faileth not, nor does his Father’s.</p><p>With such mature love, the kind that exemplifies, empowers, and imparts, ours will not fail either. If sometimes the harder you try to be, the more difficult it seems to get, if just as you work on your limitations and shortcomings, you find someone or something determined to challenge your returning faith, remember that it has been so for some of the most faithful and marvelous people in every era of time.</p><p>Also remember that there is a force in this universe determined to oppose every good thing you try to do. So, through abundance as well as poverty, through private acclaim as well as public criticism, through the divine elements of the restoration as well as the human foibles that inevitably will be part of it, we stay the course with the true Church of Christ. Why?</p><p>Because, as with our Redeemer, we signed on for the whole term—not ending with the first short introductory quiz but through to the final exam. The joy in this is that the Headmaster gave us all open-book answers before the course began. Furthermore, we have a host of tutors who remind us of these answers at regular stops along the way. But of course, none of this works if we keep cutting class.</p><p>By sticking with all our hearts, we answer Jesus of Nazareth when he says, 'I am.' We bow our knee and confess with our tongue that he is the living Christ, the healer and atoner for our sins, that he was carrying us even when we thought he had abandoned us. When we stand before him and see the wounds in his hands and feet, we will be given to comprehend what it meant for him to bear our sins and be acquainted with grief—to be completely obedient to the will of his Father, all out of pure love for us.</p><p>To introduce others to faith, repentance, baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and receiving our blessings as part of the temple experience, we—the sacred blessings of the House of the Lord—these fundamental principles and ordinances that ultimately reveal the love of God and joyfully characterize the true Church of Christ will be evident.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, I testify that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the vehicle God has provided for the exaltation of our souls. The gospel it teaches is true, and the priesthood legitimizing it is not derivative. I testify that Russell M. Nelson is a prophet of our God, and his predecessors were as well, and his successors will be.</p><p>One day that prophetic generation will lead a generation to see our messenger of salvation descending like lightning out of the east, and we will exclaim, 'Jesus of Nazareth.' And with arms forever outstretched in love, he will reply, 'I am he.' I so promise with the Apostolic power and authority of his holy name, even Jesus Christ. Amen.</p></div> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-svelte-h="svelte-tyn8xv"><i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i></button></div></div> </div></div> </div></div> </div><div class="accordion" id="mfwvlps0pn9zeiwfjmt1-1"><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapse-mfwvlps0pn9zeiwfjmt1-1" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapse-mfwvlps0pn9zeiwfjmt1-1"><span>Sister Tracy Y.

Browning</strong> <br><small>Primary General Presidency Second Counselor</small></div></div>        <div class="d-flex gap-3"><div><p>The energy space. However, a lingering question remained within the scientific community regarding the origin of a particular type of comment that astronomers regularly tracked. And that question, persisted for decades before the discovery of another distant region of our solar system. With the limited knowledge they had, scientists used those intervening decades to produce significant technological advances, but allow for further study and exploration.</p><p>Their eventual breakthrough reconfigured our planetary zone and resulted in Pluto being re-homed to this new region of space and our solar system consisting of eight planets.</p><p>One leading planetary scientist and principal investigator for the New Horizon space mission tasked with exploring Pluto elements had this to say about this experience: 'We thought we understood the geography of our solar system. We didn't, in fact, we misunderstood the population of planets in our solar system, and we went wrong.'</p><p>What's striking to me about this period of space exploration history are some parallels and key distinctions between the metaphorical pursuits of expanding scientific horizons and the journey that we, as children of God, undertake to seek answers to our spiritual questions. Specifically, how we can respond to the limits of our spiritual understanding and prepare ourselves for the next stage of personal growth and where we can turn for help.</p><p>Asking questions and searching for meaning is a natural and normal part of our mortal experience. At times, not readily having complete answers can bring us to the edge of our understanding, and those limitations can feel frustrating or overwhelming.</p><p>For all of us, it is designed to help us progress despite our limitations and accomplish what we cannot accomplish on our own, even without a complete knowledge of all things. God's plan is merciful towards the limitations of our humanity, provides us with our Savior Jesus Christ to be our Good Shepherd, and inspires us to use our agency to choose him.</p><p>Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf has taught that asking questions isn't a sign of weakness, but rather it's a precursor of growth. Speaking directly to our personal effort as seekers of truth, our prophet, President Russell M. Nelson, has taught that we must have a deep desire and ask with a sincere heart and real intent.</p><p>Having faith in Jesus Christ, he further taught, means that real intent is when one truly intends to follow the divine direction given. Our personal effort to grow in wisdom may lead us to examine our questions, complex or otherwise, through the lens of cause and effect, seeking out and recognizing patterns, and then forming narratives to give shape to our understanding and still pursue truth and knowledge.</p><p>When we consider our pursuit of spiritual knowledge, however, these thoughtful processes may be helpful at times, but on their own, they can be incomplete. As we look to discern things pertaining to Heavenly Father and our Savior Jesus Christ, the gospel, their church, and their plan for all of us, God's way of imparting wisdom to us prioritizes inviting the power of the Holy Ghost to be our personal teacher.</p><p>As we center Jesus Christ in our lives and in our faithful seeking for their answers and their meaning, we discover truth through devoted times of studying the Holy Scriptures and seeking revealed truths for our day and our time, imparted by modern-day prophets and apostles. The invitation is to spend regular worshipful time in the house of the Lord and to take to our knees in prayer to access information from heaven.</p><p>Jesus' promise to those present during the Sermon on the Mount is as true for us in our day as it was during his earthly ministry: 'Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.' Our Savior assures us that 'your Father which is in heaven gives good things to them that ask him.'</p><p>The Lord's method of teaching is line upon line, precept upon precept. We may be required to wait upon the Lord in the space between our current line of understanding and the next yet to be delivered. This sacred space can be a place where our greatest spiritual conditioning can occur, a site where we can bear with patience our earnest seeking and renew our strength to continue to keep the sacred promises we've made to God through covenants.</p><p>Our relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ signals our prevailing citizenship in God's kingdom, and our residency therein requires aligning our life to divine principles and putting in the effort to grow spiritually.</p><p>One key principle taught throughout the Book of Mormon is that when God's children choose to demonstrate obedience and keep their covenants, they receive continual spiritual guidance and direction. The Lord has told us that through our obedience and diligence, we may gain knowledge and intelligence. God's laws and commandments are not designed to be an obstacle in our life but a powerful gateway to personal revelation and spiritual education.</p><p>President Nelson has taught that a crucial truth of revelation from God is always compatible with his eternal law and that it never contradicts his doctrine. Your willing obedience to God's commands, despite not having complete knowledge of his reasons, places you in the company of his prophets.</p><p>In Moses chapter 5, teaching us about a particular interaction between Adam and an angel of the Lord: After the Lord gave Adam and Eve commandments that they should worship the Lord their God and offer the firstlings of their flock as offerings unto the Lord, the scriptures say that Adam was obedient unto the commandments of the Lord. Later, an angel of the Lord appeared unto Adam and said, 'Why dost thou offer sacrifices unto the Lord?' And Adam said unto him, 'I know not, save the Lord commanded me.'</p><p>Adam's obedience preceded his understanding and prepared him to receive the sacred knowledge that he was participating in a symbol of the atonement of Jesus Christ. Our humble obedience will likewise pave the way for our spiritual discernment of God's ways and his divine purposes for each of us.</p><p>Reaching to elevate our obedience brings us closer to our Savior, Jesus Christ, because obedience to his laws and commandments is effectively reaching out to him.</p><p>Additionally, our fidelity to the knowledge and wisdom we already have, through our faithful adherence to gospel principles and sacred covenants, is crucial preparation for our readiness to receive and be stewards of communications from the Holy Spirit.</p><p>Jesus Christ, the source of all truth, shares wisdom liberally. Also, understanding that we do not possess any personal knowledge independent of God helps us know who to turn to and where to place our primary trust.</p><p>The Old Testament account of Naaman, the military leader who was healed of leprosy by the prophet Elisha, is a particular favorite of mine. The story illustrates how the firm faith of a little girl altered the course of one man's life, and for all believers, revealed the reach of God's mercy to those who placed their trust in him and his prophet.</p><p>This young girl also helped to push understanding forward, and Naaman's belief in her testimony inspired him to take his petition for healing to God's chosen servant.</p><p>Naaman's response to the prophet Elisha's instructions to wash in the River Jordan was at first skeptical and indignant. But an invitation for him to be obedient to the prophet's counsel made way for his healing and his dramatic understanding that God was real.</p><p>We may find that some of our spiritual petitions have reasonably discernible answers and may not create significant discomfort for us. Or like Naaman, you may find that other demands are more challenging and may create difficult and complex feelings within us.</p><p>Or similar to the difference between the astronomers' early conclusions about our solar system and our search for spiritual truth, we may reach less accurate interpretations if we rely exclusively on our own limited understanding, the unintended consequence of which may lead us away from the covenant path.</p><p>And while some questions may persist until God, who has all power, wisdom, and understanding and comprehendeth all things, provides enlightenment, we must continue to believe on his name.</p><p>One significant caution from Naaman's account is that resisting obedience to God's laws and commandments may prolong or delay our growth.</p><p>We are blessed to have Jesus Christ as our master healer. Our obedience to God's laws and commandments can open the way for our Savior to provide the understanding and healing he knows we need, according to his prescribed treatment plan for us.</p><p>Elder Richard G. Scott taught that this life is an experience in profound trust—trust in Jesus Christ, trust in his teachings, trust in our capacity, as led by the Holy Spirit, to obey those teachings for happiness now and for our purposeful, supremely eternal existence.</p><p>Scott continued that to exercise faith is to trust that the Lord knows what he's doing with you and that he can accomplish it for your eternal good, even though you cannot understand how he can possibly do it.</p><p>Friends, I testify that our sincere gospel questions can provide Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ with opportunities to help us grow. My personal effort to seek answers from the Lord to my own spiritual questions, past and present, has allowed me to use the space between the lines of my understanding and God's to practice obedience to him and fidelity to the spiritual knowledge I currently possess.</p><p>By placing your trust in Heavenly Father and in his prophets, whom he has set, will help you spiritually elevate and push you forward toward God's expanded horizon. Your vantage will change because you will change. God knows the higher you are, the farther you can see.</p><p>Our Savior invites you to make that climb, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p></div> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-svelte-h="svelte-tyn8xv"><i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i></button></div></div> </div></div> </div></div> </div><div class="accordion" id="mfwvlps0pn9zeiwfjmt1-2"><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapse-mfwvlps0pn9zeiwfjmt1-2" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapse-mfwvlps0pn9zeiwfjmt1-2"><span>Elder Brook P.

Hales"> <div><h2>Mortality Works</h2> <strong>Elder Brook P. Hales</strong> <br><small>General Authority Seventy</small></div></div>        <div class="d-flex gap-3"><div><p>For several years, I was assigned to home teach an older sister in my ward. She did not have an easy life. She had various health problems and experienced a lifetime of pain due to a childhood accident on the playground. Divorced at age 32, with four young children to raise and provide for, she remarried at age 50.</p><p>Her second husband passed away when she was 66, and she lived an additional 26 years. Despite her lifelong challenges, she was faithful to her covenants to the end. The sister was an avid homemaker, tender and loving, and a recorder and writer of family histories. Because she had many difficult trials.</p><p>Without question, she felt at times sadness and weariness. Yet she had a cheerful countenance, a gracious and pleasant personality. Nine months after her passing, one of her sons had a remarkable experience in the temple. He learned by the power of the Holy Ghost that his mother had a message for him.</p><p>She communicated with him, not by vision or audible words. The following unmistakable message came into the son's mind: 'From this moment, I want you to know that mortality works. And I want you to know that I now understand why everything happened in my life the way it did, and it is all okay.'</p><p>The message is all the more remarkable when one considers her situation and the difficulties this sister endured and overcame. Brothers and sisters, mortality works. It is designed to work. Despite the challenges, heartaches, and difficulties we all face. Our loving, wise, and perfect Heavenly Father has designed the plan of happiness.</p><p>Such that we are not destined to fail. His plan provides a way for us to rise above our mortal failures. The Lord has said, 'This is my work and my glory: to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.' Nonetheless, if we are to be the beneficiaries of the Lord's work and glory, even immortality and eternal life, we must expect to be schooled and taught and to pass through the refiner's fire, sometimes to our utter limits.</p><p>To completely avoid the problems, challenges, and difficulties of this world would sidestep the process that is truly necessary for mortality. And so we should not be surprised when hard times come upon us. We will encounter situations, trials, and people who enable us to practice true charity and patience. But we need to bear up under our difficulties and remember, as the Lord said, 'He that layeth down his life in my cause, for my name's sake, shall find it again, even life eternal.'</p><p>Or, 'Be not afraid of your enemies, or your problems, challenges, or the tests of this life. Cry unto me for strength, and I will consecrate your afflictions for your gain.'</p><p>When we grow discouraged or anxious about our problems or feel that we might be receiving more than our fair share of life's difficulties, we can remember what the Lord said to the children of Israel: 'And thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldst keep his commandments or no.'</p><p>As Lehi taught his son Jacob, 'Thou hast suffered afflictions and much sorrow. Nevertheless, God shall consecrate thine afflictions for thy gain.' Wherefore, I know that they are redeemed because of the righteousness of thy Redeemer.</p><p>Because this life is a testing ground and dark clouds of trouble hang over us and threaten our peace, it is helpful to remember this counsel from Mosiah 23, relating to life's challenges: 'Nevertheless, whosoever putteth his trust in the Lord shall be lifted up at the last day.'</p><p>As a youth, I personally experienced great emotional pain and shame because of the unrighteous actions of another. For many years, it affected my self-worth and my sense of worthiness before the Lord. Nevertheless, I bear personal witness that the Lord can strengthen us and bear us up in whatever difficulties we are called upon to experience during our sojourn in this veil of tears.</p><p>We are familiar with Paul's experience: 'Lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure. For this thing, I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me. And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect in weakness.'</p><p>Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. We do not know what Paul's thorn in the flesh was, and he chose not to describe it—whether it was a physical ailment, a mental or emotional infirmity, or a temptation. But we don't need to know that detail to understand that he struggled and pleaded with the Lord for help and that, ultimately, the Lord's strength and power are what helped him through.</p><p>Like Paul, it was through the Lord's help that I was eventually strengthened emotionally and spiritually, and I finally recognized, after many years, that I have always been a beloved child of God and worthy of the blessings of the gospel.</p><p>The Savior helped me overcome my feelings of unworthiness and to extend sincere forgiveness to the offender. I finally understood that the Savior's Atonement was for me. Heavenly Father and His Son loved me perfectly. Because of the Savior's Atonement, mortality works. While I was eventually blessed to recognize how the Savior rescued and sustained me through those experiences, I clearly understand that the unfortunate situation of my teenage years was my personal journey and experience.</p><p>The solution to which, and its initial outcome, cannot be projected onto those who have suffered and continue to suffer from the unrighteous behavior of others.</p><p>I recognize that life's experiences, good and bad, can teach us important lessons. I now know more deeply than ever before that mortality works. I hope that as a result of the sum of my life's experiences, both good and bad, I have compassion for innocent victims of others' actions and empathy for the downtrodden.</p><p>I sincerely hope that as a result of my life's experiences, both good and bad, I am kinder to others, less judgmental, and possess the integrity and compassion that the Savior would have.</p><p>As we come to rely on the Savior's grace and keep our covenants, we can serve as examples of the far-reaching effects of the Savior's Atonement.</p><p>I share a final example that mortality works. My mother did not have an easy journey through mortality. She received no accolades or worldly honors and did not have educational opportunities beyond high school. She contracted polio as a child, resulting in a lifetime of pain and discomfort in her left leg. As an adult, she experienced many difficult and challenging physical and financial circumstances, but she was faithful to her covenants and loved the Lord.</p><p>When my mother was 55, my next older sister passed away, leaving an eight-month-old baby daughter, my niece, motherless. Mom ended up largely raising my niece for the next 17 years, often under very trying circumstances.</p><p>Yet notwithstanding these experiences, she happily and willingly served her family, neighbors, and ward members and served as an ordinance worker in the temple for many years. During the last several years of her life, Mom suffered from a form of dementia, was often confused, and was confined to a nursing facility. Regrettably, she was alone when she passed away unexpectedly.</p><p>Several months after her passing, I had a dream I have never forgotten. In my dream, I was sitting in my office at Church Administration, and Mom entered the office. I knew she had come from the spirit world. I will always remember the feelings I had. She did not say anything, but she radiated a spiritual beauty that I had never before experienced and which I have difficulty describing.</p><p>Her countenance was truly stunning. I remember saying to her, 'Mother, you are so beautiful,' referencing her spiritual power and beauty. She acknowledged me, again without speaking. I felt her love for me, and I knew then that she is happy and healed from her earthly cares and challenges, eagerly awaiting a glorious resurrection.</p><p>I know that for Mom, mortality worked, and that it works for us. God's work and glory is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man. The experiences of mortality are part of the journey that allows us to grow and progress toward immortality and eternal life. We were not sent here to fail but to succeed in God's plan for us.</p><p>King Benjamin taught: 'Moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end, they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness.'</p><p>In other words, mortality works. I testify that as we receive the ordinances of the gospel, enter into covenants with God, and then keep those covenants—repent, serve others, and endure to the end—we too can have the assurance and complete trust in the Lord that mortality works.</p><p>I testify of Jesus Christ and that our glorious future with our Heavenly Father is made possible by the grace and Atonement of the Savior, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p></div> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-svelte-h="svelte-tyn8xv"><i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i></button></div></div> </div></div> </div></div> </div><div class="accordion" id="mfwvlps0pn9zeiwfjmt1-3"><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapse-mfwvlps0pn9zeiwfjmt1-3" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapse-mfwvlps0pn9zeiwfjmt1-3"><span>Bishop L.

Todd Budge</strong> <br><small>Presiding Bishopric Second Counselor</small></div></div>        <div class="d-flex gap-3"><div><p>During our visit to our mission, by then Elder Russell Adam, the missionaries asked him how best to respond when a person tells them that they are too busy to listen to them. With little hesitation, President Nelson said, 'I would ask if they were too busy to eat lunch that day and then teach them that they have both a body and a spirit, and just as their body will die if not nourished, so shall their spirit if not nourished by the good word of God.'</p><p>It's interesting to note that the Japanese word for 'busy', 'isogashi', is made up of a character with two symbols. The one on the left means 'heart' or 'spirit', and the one on the right means 'death', suggesting, perhaps as President Nelson taught, that being too busy to nourish our spirit can lead us to die spiritually.</p><p>The Lord knew in this fast-paced world, full of distractions and commotion, that making quality time for Him would be one of the major challenges in our day. Speaking through the prophet Isaiah, He provided these words of counsel and caution, which can be likened unto the tumultuous days in which we live: 'In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength, and ye would not.'</p><p>'But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.' In other words, even though our salvation depends on returning to Him often and resting from the cares of the world, we do not. And even though our confidence will come from a strength developed in quiet time spent with the Lord in meditation and reflection, we do not.</p><p>Why not? Because we say, 'No, we are busy with other things, fleeing upon our horses, so to speak.' Therefore, we get further and further away from God, and we will insist on going faster and faster. And the faster we go, the swifter Satan will follow and pursue. Perhaps this is why President Nelson has repeatedly pleaded with us to make time for the Lord in our lives.</p><p>Each and every day, he reminds us that quiet time is sacred time, time that will facilitate personal revelation and instill peace. But to hear the still, small voice of the Lord, we, too, must be still. Being still, however, requires more than just making time for the Lord; it requires letting go of our doubtful and wandering thoughts and focusing our hearts and minds on Him.</p><p>Elder David A. Bednar taught that the Lord’s admonition to 'be still' entails much more than simply not talking or not moving. 'Be still,' he suggested, may be a way of reminding us to focus upon the Savior unfailingly.</p><p>Being still is an act of faith and requires effort. The Lectures on Faith state: 'When a man works by faith, he works by mental exertion.' President Nelson declared, 'Our focus must be riveted on the Savior and His gospel. It is mentally rigorous to strive to look unto Him in every thought, but when we do, our doubts and fears flee.'</p><p>Speaking of this need to focus our minds, President David O. McKay once said: 'I think we pay too little attention to the value of meditation, a principle of devotion. Meditation is one of the most sacred doors through which we pass into the presence of the Lord.'</p><p>There is a word in Japanese, 'mui,' that for me captures this more faith-filled, contemplative sense of what it means to be still. It’s comprised of two characters: the one on the left means 'nothing' or 'nothingness,' and the one on the right means 'to do.' Together, 'mui,' or 'non-doing,' taken literally, could be misinterpreted to mean 'to do nothing,' in the same way that 'be still' can be misinterpreted as not talking or moving. However, like the phrase 'be still,' it has a higher meaning.</p><p>For me, it is a reminder to slow down and live with greater spiritual awareness. While serving in the Asia North Area presidency, Elder Takashi Wada, I learned that his wife’s sister, Naomi Wada, is an accomplished Japanese calligrapher. I asked Elder Wada if she would draw for me the Japanese characters for the word 'mui.'</p><p>The calligraphy now hangs on my wall as a reminder to be still and to focus on the Savior. I was surprised when she did not readily agree to this seemingly simple request. The next day, sensing that I had likely misunderstood her hesitance, Elder Wada explained that writing those characters would require significant effort.</p><p>She would need to ponder and meditate on the concept and the characters until she understood the meaning deeply in her soul and could give expression to these heartfelt impressions with each stroke of her brush. I was embarrassed that I had so casually asked her to do something so demanding.</p><p>I asked him to convey my apologies to her for my ignorance and to let her know that I was withdrawing my request. You can imagine my surprise and gratitude when, upon arriving in Japan, Sister Wada unsolicitedly gifted to me this beautiful piece of calligraphy featuring the Japanese word 'mui.'</p><p>It now hangs prominently on the wall of my office, reminding me to be still and to seek the Lord every day with all my heart, might, mind, and strength. She had captured in this artwork the meaning of 'mui' or stillness better than any words could.</p><p>Rather than mindlessly and dutifully drawing the characters, she approached her task with whole purpose of heart and real intent. Likewise, God desires that we approach our time with Him with the same kind of heartfelt devotion. When we do so, our worship becomes an expression of our love for Him, a chance for us to commune with Him.</p><p>On one occasion, after I gave the invocation in a meeting with the First Presidency, President Nelson turned to me and said, 'While you were praying, I thought how much God must appreciate it when we take time from our busy schedules to acknowledge Him.'</p><p>It was a simple yet powerful reminder of how much it means to the Lord when we pause to commune with Him. Much as He desires our attention, He will not force us to come to Him. To the Nephites, the resurrected Lord said: 'How oft would I have gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens, and ye would not.'</p><p>He followed that with this hopeful invitation that also applies to us today: 'How oft will I gather you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, if ye will repent and return unto me with full purpose of heart.'</p><p>The gospel of Jesus Christ gives us opportunities to return to Him often. These opportunities include daily prayer, scripture study, the sacrament, the Sabbath day, and temple worship.</p><p>If we were to take these sacred opportunities off our to-do lists and put them on our 'non-doing' list, to approach them with the same mindfulness and focus with which Sister Wada approaches her calligraphy, we may be thinking, 'I don’t have time for that.' I have often felt the same.</p><p>But let me suggest that what we may need is not necessarily more time, but more awareness of it and focus on God during the times we already set aside for Him.</p><p>For example, when praying, what if we were to spend less time talking and more time just being with God? What if we were to give more heartfelt and specific expressions of gratitude and love?</p><p>President Nelson has counseled that we not just read the scriptures but savor them. What difference would it make if we were to do less reading and more savoring? What if we were more intentional in preparing our minds to partake of the sacrament and joyfully ponder the blessings of the Atonement of Jesus Christ during that sacred ordinance?</p><p>The Hebrew word for Sabbath means 'rest.' What if we were to rest from other cares and take time to sit quietly with the Lord and pour out our emotions unto Him?</p><p>During our temple worship, what if we were to make a more disciplined effort to pay attention or linger a little longer in the celestial room in quiet reflection?</p><p>When our focus is less on doing and more on strengthening our covenant connection with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, I testify that each of these sacred moments will be enriched, and we will receive the guidance needed in our personal lives.</p><p>Martha, in the account in the book of Luke, was careful and troubled about many things. However, as we commune with the Lord and stay still, He will help us to know that which is most needful.</p><p>Even the Savior took time from His ministry to be still. The scriptures are replete with examples of the Lord retreating to a solitary place, a mountain, the wilderness, a desert place, or going a little way off to pray to the Father.</p><p>If Jesus Christ sought quiet time to commune with God and to be strengthened, it would be wise for us to do the same. As we concentrate our hearts and minds on Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and listen to the still, small voice of the Holy Ghost, we will have greater clarity about what is most needful, develop deeper compassion, and find rest and strength in Him.</p><p>Participating with God in His work of salvation and exaltation may require that we slow down. Being always in motion may be adding to the commotion in our lives and robbing us of the peace we seek.</p><p>I testify that as we turn often to the Lord with full purpose of heart, we will in quietness and confidence come to know Him and feel His infinite, compassionate love for us.</p><p>He has promised: 'Draw near unto me and I will draw near unto you; seek me diligently and ye shall find me.' 'And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.' I testify that this promise is true, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p></div> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-svelte-h="svelte-tyn8xv"><i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i></button></div></div> </div></div> </div></div> </div><div class="accordion" id="mfwvlps0pn9zeiwfjmt1-4"><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapse-mfwvlps0pn9zeiwfjmt1-4" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapse-mfwvlps0pn9zeiwfjmt1-4"><span>Elder Gary E.

Stevenson"> <div><h2>Days Never To Be Forgotten</h2> <strong>Elder Gary E. Stevenson</strong> <br><small>Quorum of the Twelve Apostles</small></div></div>        <div class="d-flex gap-3"><div><p>My dreams and sisters. The history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in this dispensation is the splendid of divine experiences that demonstrate how the Lord has guided his church. There is one decade in our history, however, that stands strikingly supreme above any other: the decade from 1820 to 1830, beginning with the prophet Joseph Smith Sr. to the Sacred Grove in the spring of 1820, when he saw God the Father and Jesus Christ, and continuing until April 6, 1830.</p><p>That decade is like any other. Remarkable events: the young Prophet conversed with the angel Moroni, translated the gold plates, and published The Book of Mormon. It was key through which the Aaronic and Melchizedek priesthood were restored, and then he organized the church. Oliver Cowdery described that era well, 'These were days never to be forgotten.' Miraculous events have continued to this very day. May I be so bold as to suggest that this year, we have commenced a decade that may prove to be as momentous as any that has followed that unparalleled founding decade two centuries ago.</p><p>Let me explain. Between now, 2024, and 2034, we will experience the seminal events that will result in extraordinary opportunities to serve.</p><p>To unite with members and friends and introduce the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to more people than ever before. We just witnessed a truly historic moment as we celebrated with tens of millions, the 100th birthday of President Russell M. Nelson. Reporting on President Nelson's birthday, Newsweek wrote a headline that read: 'World's oldest religious leader turns 100.' They then listed the ten oldest leaders, with President Nelson first on a list that included Pope Francis and Dalai Lama.</p><p>This statement from a New York Times article represents the spirit of much of the international coverage: 'A presidential election cycle that has prompted soul searching about aging in leadership, Mr. Nelson’s milestone suggests that at least in his church, a triple-digit birthday does not merit much hand-wringing.' He remains a popular figure among church members who view their president not just as an executive, but as a prophet, seer, and revelator. How grateful we are that President Nelson's landmark birthday gave us an opportunity to introduce a global audience to a prophet of God—a celebration never to be forgotten.</p><p>Earlier this spring, a refurbished plaza on Temple Square featuring a display of international flags representing countries where the church is organized was unveiled. The plaza entrance is marked by a grand monument with these prophetic words: 'And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills, and all nations shall flow unto it.' Surely the monumental events that will occur during the next ten years constitute one manifestation of this prophecy of Isaiah being fulfilled.</p><p>Contemplate the unprecedented number of temple open houses and dedications that are required to take place over the next decade. Even the potential of 164 temples and counting. Imagine tens of millions of you and your friends walking through a house of the Lord. The symbolic center of these events will be the rededication of the Salt Lake Temple and the activities associated with it. These will certainly be days never to be forgotten.</p><p>2030 will bring opportunities worldwide to commemorate the bicentennial of the organization of the church. Although it’s too early to say how the church will recognize this milestone, it will certainly allow us to invite family, friends, colleagues, and distinguished guests to come and see and to better understand the powerful impact it has in the lives of church members.</p><p>And in 2034, thousands of dignitaries, visitors, and athletes from around the world will flood the streets of Salt Lake City, the stage for the Winter Olympic Games. There is perhaps no greater demonstration of worldwide unity than that abiding theme of the games. The eyes of the world will be upon the church, affording members a multitude of opportunities to volunteer, serve, and share glad tidings through kind deeds—an event never to be forgotten.</p><p>These upcoming moments will provide members of the church everywhere with increased opportunities to share glad tidings of the gospel of Jesus Christ through word and deed—a decade never to be forgotten.</p><p>In a meeting just weeks before his birthday, President Nelson shared the reason he cherishes the phrase 'Glad Tidings.' On the face of it, he noted, the phrase rings of joy and happiness. But glad tidings convey much more than that. The weight of this phrase comes from the original Greek, 'euangelion,' which literally means good news or the gospel. Happiness and joy in this life and the next are always linked with the gospel of Jesus Christ. Thus, the phrase 'glad tidings' captures this double meaning in a wonderful way. Man and woman are that they might have joy. Heavenly Father has provided the plan of happiness that enables joy through his blessings. These include living in his presence eternally as families.</p><p>The Atonement of Jesus Christ is central to God’s plan. To receive eternal life, we must come unto Christ. As we do so and help others do the same, we participate in God’s work of salvation and exaltation. This message of the glad tidings of the gospel of Jesus Christ is the most important message on earth. And that is where the youth and young adults of the church come in.</p><p>Now, while this upcoming decade may be filled with days never to be forgotten for every member of the church, this especially can be true for the rising generation. You are here on earth now because you were selected to be here now. You have the strength and the capacity to be disciples of Christ in an unprecedented way.</p><p>God has reserved spirits for this dispensation who have the courage and determination to face the world and all the powers of the evil one and to build up the Zion of our God, fearless of all consequences.</p><p>To that end, I wish to speak to you of the rising generation, to invite you to imagine how exciting this next decade—one never to be forgotten—can be for you. I offer simple words of counsel and encouragement that may empower you during this coming decade.</p><p>Like many of you, I have a smartphone that on occasion, without prompt, pulls together a reel of photos showing what I was doing on a certain day. It’s always surprising to see how much things have changed for me and my family in just a few years.</p><p>Picture your photos. Your phone will serve up ten years from now. You may see yourself graduating from high school or college, receiving your endowment, going on a mission, getting married, and having your first child. For you personally, this will be a decade never to be forgotten.</p><p>But it will be doubly so if you actively become a beacon unto the world of how the glad tidings of the gospel of Jesus Christ can enrich and enhance not only your life but those of your family, friends, and social media followers.</p><p>You may be wondering how to do this. Prophets of God have taught us this is done through four simple activities referred to as divinely appointed responsibilities: first, living the gospel of Jesus Christ; second, caring for those in need; third, inviting all to receive the gospel; and fourth, uniting families for eternity.</p><p>Remarkably, each can be done in the most normal and natural ways. I promise this will be a decade never to be forgotten for you if you embrace these divinely appointed responsibilities.</p><p>Let’s consider what this might entail. First, live the gospel of Jesus Christ. Study the words of the prophets and learn to love your Heavenly Father. Incline your hearts to Him and strive to walk in His way. Be lifted by the covenant confidence that early Latter-day Saints described. This confidence comes from making covenants to follow Jesus Christ, knowing that the Savior will in turn strengthen and support you. Let your friends see the joy you feel in the gospel, and you will be the best gospel message they ever receive.</p><p>Second, reach out in compassion to care for those in need. Your generation is unusually mindful of the less fortunate. When disaster strikes and church members rush to help clear away debris and comfort the afflicted, it seems the majority wearing 'Helping Hands' t-shirts are teenagers or twenty-somethings. It is in their nature to bear one another’s burdens and to comfort those that stand in need of comfort. By doing this, we fulfill the law of Christ.</p><p>A young primary-age boy decided to spend his summer vacation from school gathering supplies for peanut butter and jelly sandwiches to donate to his local food bank. He found the project on the JustServe website. Young Everett enlisted his entire school class to help collect over 700 jars of jelly. Let the people you serve know that your concern for them is rooted in your love of God and your desire to treat your neighbor as yourself.</p><p>Third, invite all to receive the gospel. This year, we opened 36 missions worldwide to accommodate all who have the desire to serve full-time missions. In an era when many youth are opting out of formal religious activity altogether, this is remarkable and speaks to the magnificent nature of your testimonies. Whether serving full-time or not, please realize your immense capacity to influence your peers as you love, share, and invite them to explore the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p><p>Fourth, unite families for eternity. As I visit temples around the world, I marvel at the stunningly large crowds of youth waiting at the baptistry and at the increased number of young adults serving as ordinance workers. Recently, a group of over 600 youth from Scotland and Ireland traveled to the Preston England Temple, performing over 4,000 ordinances, many of which were for their personal deceased ancestors.</p><p>I urge you to become engaged in family history, spend time in the temple, carefully prepare yourself to be the kind of man or woman ready to marry an equally worthy companion in the temple, and develop a pattern in your life now to make the temple a regular part of your lives.</p><p>My beloved brothers and sisters, my dear young friends, there will likely be difficulties for each of us in this era. However, as we enter this coming decade, in unprecedented involvement, may we share glad tidings from the simple activities of living, caring, inviting, and uniting.</p><p>As we do so, the Lord will bless us with experiences never to be forgotten. I testify that to those who approach the Lord with a sincere heart, He can. To those who ask, He may perceive, or upon their lives, the Holy Spirit in their souls. To those who embark upon this grand and glorious endeavor, you will discover and experience bounteous celestial blessings and receive a witness that God hears you, knows you, and loves you.</p><p>You will experience it all in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p></div> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-svelte-h="svelte-tyn8xv"><i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i></button></div></div> </div></div> </div></div> </div><div class="accordion" id="mfwvlps0pn9zeiwfjmt1-5"><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapse-mfwvlps0pn9zeiwfjmt1-5" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapse-mfwvlps0pn9zeiwfjmt1-5"><span>Brother Bradley R.

Wilcox</strong> <br><small>Young Men General Presidency First Counselor</small></div></div>        <div class="d-flex gap-3"><div><p>Never to be forgotten. Our family has always enjoyed a little book called children's letters to God. Here are you? Dear God, instead of letting people die and having to make new ones, why don't you just keep the ones you've got right now?</p><p>How come you only have 10 rules? Our school has millions.</p><p>Why did you put the tonsils in and you're just going to take them out again? Today, there isn't time to answer all these questions, but there is another question. I often hear from young people that I would like to address from, um, Mongolia to Thomas Idaho, the question is the same. Why, why must Latter-Day Saints live so differently from others? I know it's hard to be different especially when you were young and want so badly for other people to, like you care. Everyone wants to fit in and that desire is magnified to unhealthy proportions in today's digital world, through his social media, and cyber bullying.</p><p>Of all that pressure. Why do Latter-Day Saints live so different? There are many good answers because you are a child of God, because you have been staked for the last days because you are a disciple of Jesus Christ. But those answers, go always set you apart. Everyone is a child of God. Everyone on Earth right now was sent here in the latter days. And yet, not everyone knows the word of wisdom or law of chastity where you strategy. There are many valuable disciples of Christ who are not members of this church, but they do not serve missions and perform ordinances in houses of the Lord on behalf of ancestors like we do.</p><p>Must be more into it. And there is. Today, I would like to focus on an additional reason that has been meaningful in my life. In 1988 a young Apostle named Russell M. Nelson gave an address at Brigham Young University called, Thanks for the Covenant. In it, then Elder Nelson explained that when we use our moral agency to make and keep covenants with God, we become Heirs of the Everlasting Covenant that God has made with our forbearers in every dispensation. Another way we become children of the covenant, that sets us apart. That gives us access to the same blessings our forefathers and foremothers received including a birthright.</p><p>Birthright. You may have heard that word. We even sing hymns about it. Oh, youth of the noble birthright carry on, carry on, carry on. It's a compelling word. But what does it mean? In Old Testament times that her father passed away. His birthright son was responsible for the care of his mother and sisters. His brothers received their inheritance and left to make their way in the world. But when the birthright son did not go anywhere he would marry and have his own family and he would stand till the end of his days to gather affairs of his father's estate.</p><p>This added responsibility, he was given an added measure of the inheritance. Was leading and caring for others, too much to ask? Not, when you consider the additional inheritance he was given. Today, we are not talking about our birth order in earthly families or Old Testament gender roles. We are talking about the inheritance you receive as a joint heir with Christ because of the covenant relationship you have chosen to enter with him and your father in Heaven. Is it too much for God to expect you to live differently than his other children? So you can better lead and serve them? Not when you consider the blessings, both temporal and spiritual that you have been given.</p><p>Does birthright mean you are better than others? No. But it does mean you are expected to help others be better. Does your birthright mean you are chosen? Yes. But not chosen to rule over others, you are chosen to serve them. Is your birthright evidence of God's love? Yes. But more important, it is evidence of his trust. It is one thing to be loved, and another thing entirely to be trusted. In the For the Strength of Youth guide, we read, 'Your father in Heaven trusts you.' He has given you great blessings, including the fullness of the gospel and sacred ordinances and covenants that bind you to him and bring his power into your life. With those blessings comes added responsibility. He knows you can make a difference in the world and that requires in many cases being different from the world.</p><p>Our mortal experience could be compared to a cruise ship on which God has sent all his children as they journey from one shore to another. The voyage is filled with opportunities to learn, grow, be happy and progress, but it is also full of dangers. God loves all his children and is concerned about their welfare. He does not want to lose any of them. So, he invites those who are willing to become members of his crew.</p><p>Because of your choice to make and keep covenants, he offers you his trust. He trusts you to be different, peculiar and set apart because of the important work he trusts you to do. Think of it. Of all the people on the Earth. God trusts you, the children of the covenant, his crew members. To help with his work of bringing all his children safely home to him. No wonder President Brigham Young once said, 'All the angels in heaven are looking at this little handful of Saints.' When you look around on this cruise ship called Earth, you might see other people sitting in lounge chairs, drinking, gambling in casinos, wearing clothing that is too revealing, scrolling endlessly on cell phones, and wasting too much time playing electronics.</p><p>But instead of wondering why can't I do that? You can remember that you are not an ordinary passenger. You are a member of the crew. You have responsibilities that passengers do not have. As Sister Ardeth Kapp once said, 'You can’t be a lifeguard if you look like all the other swimmers on the beach.' And before you become discouraged by all the extra obligations, please remember that crew members receive something that other passengers do not: compensation. Elder Neil L. Andersen said, 'There is a compensatory spiritual power for the righteous, including greater assurance, greater confirmation, and greater confidence. Above all, you receive greater happiness, and peace, greater righteousness, and greater knowledge.' Your compensation is not merely a mansion in heaven and streets paved with gold.</p><p>It would be easy for Heavenly Father to simply give you all that he has. But his desire is to help you become all that he is. Your covenants demand more of you, because that is how God is making more of you. It’s a lot to ask of anyone. So as you work on just that,</p><p>Are you? And I done a couple, right? Your covenant relationship with God and Jesus Christ is a relationship of love and trust in which you have access to a greater measure of their grace, their divine assistance, endowment of strength, and enabling power. That power is not just wishful thinking, a lucky charm, or self-fulfilling prophecy. It is real. As you fulfill your birthright responsibilities, you are never alone. The Lord of the vineyard labors with you. You are working hand in hand with Jesus Christ. With each new covenant, and as your relationship with him deepens, you hold each other tighter.</p><p>And tighter. Until you are firmly clasped together in that sacred symbol of his grace. You will find the desire and the strength to live exactly how the Savior lived: differently from the world. You got this because Jesus Christ has got you. In 2 Nephi 2:6, we read, 'Wherefore, redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah; for he is full of grace and truth.' Because he is full of truth, he sees you as you really are, flaws, weaknesses, regrets, and all. Because he is full of grace, he sees you as you really can be. He meets you where you are, and helps you repent and improve, overcome and become.</p><p>Oh, youth of the noble birthright, carry on, carry on, carry on. I testify that you are loved and you are trusted today, in 20 years, and forever. Don’t sell your birthright for a mess of pottage. Don’t trade everything for nothing. Don’t let the world change you, when you were born to change the world. In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p></div> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-svelte-h="svelte-tyn8xv"><i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i></button></div></div> </div></div> </div></div> </div><div class="accordion" id="mfwvlps0pn9zeiwfjmt1-6"><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapse-mfwvlps0pn9zeiwfjmt1-6" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapse-mfwvlps0pn9zeiwfjmt1-6"><span>President Henry B.

Of the word of God. The word of God is the darker. Taught by Jesus Christ. And by his prophets, How the knew that the words of the Doctrine had great power?</p><p>In the 18th section of the Doctrine in Covenants. The Lord revealed the foundation of his Doctrine. For Remold. I command all men everywhere to repent for behold the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh. Where is wherefore, he suffered the pain of all men, but all men might repent. Come unto him. And he has risen again from the dead that he might, bring all men unto him on conditions of repentance. And you shall fall down and worship the father, in thy name. You must repent. And be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, ask the father in my name and we pray believing that you shall receive.</p><p>And you shall have the Holy Ghost. And now, After you have received this, you must keep our Commandments in all things. Take upon you, the name of Christ and speak the truth in Sovereigners. And as many as repent and are baptized in my name, which is Jesus Christ and endured in the end. Same shall be saved. In those few passages. The Savior gives us the perfect example of how we should teach his Doctrine. This Doctrine is the faith. In the Lord. Jesus Christ. Repentance. Baptism receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost and enduring to the end blesses, all of God's children.</p><p>As we teach these principles suppose, we love the Holy Ghost will help us know the truth and because we need the prompting, the Holy Ghost, we must avoid speculation of personal impact interpretation that goes, beyond teaching, true Doctrine. That can be hard to do. What do you call the person? You are trying to enterize. He or she they have ignored the doctrine Mr. Todd. It's For reveal the truth of Truth, only as we are cautious and careful not to go beyond teaching true Doctrine. One of the surest ways to avoid even getting near false Doctrine is to choose to be simple in our future. Safety is gained by that Simplicity of them, and a little is lost.</p><p>Teaching simply allows us to share the saving Doctrine early on while children remain Untouched by the deceivers Temptations. That will later confront them long before the truth. In need to learn are drowned out by the noise of social media peers and their own personal struggles. Sees every opportunity to share the teachings of Jesus Christ with children. These teaching moments are precious and far fewer compared to the religious efforts of opposing portions. For every hour spent in selling Doctrine into a child's life. There are common solids of opposition filled with messages and images that challenge or ignore those same truths.</p><p>Some of you may wonder whether it might be better to draw. Your children closer to you to having fun. Or you might ask for the child. They start to feel overwhelmed by your teaching. Instead we should consider. With so little time. And so few opportunities. Words of that. Should I assure? That will strengthen? Against the inevitable challenges to their faith. The words you share today. Could be the ones. They carry with them. And today will soon pass. I have always admired my great grandmother Mary always devotion to sharing the doctor. Of Jesus Christ. Her family was taught by missionaries in Switzerland when she was 24.</p><p>After being baptized, Mary decided to join. The Saints in America. So she made her way to Switzerland. To Berlin. And found work with a woman. Who employ her two weeks, 12. For the family's clothing. Mary lived in a servant's room and set up for Lou. Into the home's living area. At that time. Teaching, the doctrine of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saintsman was illegal in Berlin. But very fast, she could not keep from sharing the things she could earned. The woman of the house and her friends would gather around the loom. To hear Mary teach.</p><p>She spoke of the appearance of heavenly father and Jesus Christ. To Joseph Smith. The presentation of Angels. And the book of water.</p><p>The accounts of album as you thought about what blockchain of the Resurrection. She testify their families can be reunited in the solar storm Kingdom. Now, Mary is an enthusiasm to share the doctrine. Of the restored gospel. Soon, caused trouble. It was very long before the police took Mary off to jail. On the way she asked the policeman for the name of the judge, she was to appeared for the next morning. She also asked about his family. And if he was a good father and husband, The police would describe the judge as a man of the world.</p><p>In the jail, Mary requested a pencil and some paper. She spent the night writing a letter to the judge. Bearing witness to the resurrection of Jesus Christ as described in the Book of Mormon. Discussing the spirit world and explaining repentance. She suggested that the judge would need time to reflect on his life before facing final judgment. She wrote that she knew he had much to repent of Which would deeply sadden? His family and bring him bring sorrow. In the morning. When she had finished her letter, she gave her some boys and asked him to deliver her to the judge.</p><p>And he agreed to do, so. Later. The place was. By the judge to his office. So the letter Mary had written was irrefutable evidence that she was teaching the doctrine of the restorative gospel. And by so doing breaking the law, However, It wasn't long before the policeman returned to Mary cell. He told her that all charges were dismissed. And that she was free to go.

Uchtdorf</strong> <br><small>Quorum of the Twelve Apostles</small></div></div>        <div class="d-flex gap-3"><div><p>The year 2024 is something of a milestone year for me, if like, 75 years since I was baptized and confirmed, a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of early Saints, and speak out Germany.</p><p>My membership in the Church of Jesus Christ is precious to me to be counted among God's covenant people with you. My brothers and sisters is one of the greatest honors of my life.</p><p>When I think about my personal journey of discipleship, my mind often goes back to an old Villa in Mexico, where I have cherished memories of attending.</p><p>Second meetings of the Church of Jesus Christ. As a child, it is there where the seedling of my testimony received its earliest nourishing.</p><p>This Chapel had an old air-driven organ every Sunday. A young man was assigned to push up and down the sturdier Bellows to make the organ work.</p><p>I sometimes had the great pillars of assisting in this important task.</p><p>A lot of the congregations sang our beloved hymns. I pumped with all my strength, so the organ would not run out of wind.</p><p>From the Bellows operator seat, I had a great view of some stunning stained glass windows one depicting the Savior, Jesus Christ, in another portraying Joseph with the sacred Grove.</p><p>I can still remember the sacred feelings I had as I looked at those subtle windows while listening to the testimonies of the Saints and singing the hymns aside.</p><p>Place the spirit of God bore witness to my mind and heart that it is true. Jesus Christ is the savior of the world.</p><p>This is his church. The prophet Joseph Smith saw God, the Father, Jesus Christ, and heard their voices.</p><p>Earlier this year, while on assignment in Europe, I had the opportunity to return to speaker.</p><p>Sadly, that beloved old chapel isn't there anymore. It was torn down many years ago, to make room for a large apartment building.</p><p>I admit, I felt sadness to know this beloved building from my childhood is now just a memory.</p><p>It was a sacred building to me, but it was just a building.</p><p>By contrast, the spiritual witness I gained from the Holy Ghost those many years ago has not passed away.</p><p>In fact, it has grown stronger. The things I learned in my youth about the foundation of the gospel of Jesus Christ have been my firm foundation throughout my life.</p><p>The covenant connections now forged with the heavenly father, and his beloved Son have stayed with me long after this workout Chapel was dismantled, and the stained glass windows were lost.</p><p>Heaven and Earth shall pass away, Jesus said, but my words shall not pass away.</p><p>The mountains surely part, and the hills be removed, but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of thy peace be removed, says the Lord.</p><p>One of the most important things we can learn in this life is the difference between what is eternal and what is not.</p><p>Once we understand that, everything changes, our relationships, the choices we make, the way we treat people.</p><p>Knowing what is eternal and what is not is key to growing a testimony of Jesus Christ and his church.</p><p>The restored gospel of Jesus Christ, as the Prophet Joseph Smith taught, embraces all in every item of truth.</p><p>But that doesn't mean that all truth is of equal value.</p><p>Some truths are core, essential, at the root of our faith. Others are appendages or branches valuable, but only when they are connected to the fundamentals.</p><p>The Prophet Joseph also said the fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets concerning Jesus Christ, that he died, was buried, and rose again the third day and ascended into heaven, and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it.</p><p>In other words, Jesus Christ and his atoning sacrifice are the root of our testimony. All other things are branches.</p><p>This is not to say that the branches are unimportant. A tree needs branches.</p><p>As the Savior told his disciples, the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine; without a connection to the Savior, to the nourishment found in the roots, a branch withers and dies.</p><p>It comes to nourishing our testimony of Jesus Christ. I wonder if we sometimes mistake the branches for the roots.</p><p>This was a mistake Jesus observed in the Pharisees of his day. They paid so much attention to the relatively minor details of the law that they ended up neglecting what the Savior called the weightier matters, fundamental principles like justice, mercy, and faith.</p><p>If you want to nourish a tree, you don't splash water on the branches. You water the roots.</p><p>Similarly, if you want the branches of your testimony to grow and bear fruit, nourish the roots.</p><p>If you are uncertain about a particular doctrine or practice or element of church history, seek clarity with faith in Jesus Christ.</p><p>Seek to understand his sacrifice for you, his love for you, his will for you. Follow him in humility.</p><p>The branches of your testimony will draw strength from your deepening faith in Heavenly Father and his beloved Son.</p><p>For example, if you want a stronger testimony of the Book of Mormon, focus on its witness of Jesus Christ.</p><p>Notice how the Book of Mormon testifies of him, what it teaches about him, and how it invites and inspires you to come unto him.</p><p>If you're seeking a more meaningful experience in church meetings or in the temple, try looking for the Savior in the sacred ordinances we receive there.</p><p>Fight the Lord in his holy house.</p><p>If you ever feel burned out or overwhelmed by a church calling, try refocusing your service on Jesus Christ.</p><p>Make it an expression of your love for him. Nourish roots, and the branches will grow.</p><p>And in time, they will bear fruit.</p><p>Strong faith in Jesus Christ doesn't happen by accident or overnight.</p><p>In this modern world, it's the thorns and thistles of doubt that grow spontaneously.</p><p>The healthy, fruitful tree of faith requires intentional effort, and a vital part of that effort is making sure we are firmly rooted in Christ.</p><p>Example: at first, we may be drawn to the Savior's gospel and church because we are impressed by the friendly members, or by the kind bishop, or the clean looks of the chapel.</p><p>These circumstances are certainly important to grow the church.</p><p>Nevertheless, if the roots of our testimony never grow deeper than that, what will happen when we move to a ward that meets in less impressive buildings with members who aren't so friendly?</p><p>And the bishop says something that offends us?</p><p>Another example: does it seem reasonable to hope that if we keep the commandments and are sealed in the temple, we will be blessed with a large happy family with bright, obedient children, all of whom stay active in the church?</p><p>Sing in the ward choir and volunteer to help clean the meeting house every Saturday morning.</p><p>I certainly hope that all of us will have to see this in our lives.</p><p>But what if it doesn't happen?</p><p>Will we stay bound to the Savior regardless of circumstances, trusting him and his timing?</p><p>We must ask ourselves, is my testimony based on what I hope to happen in my life?</p><p>Is it dependent on the actions or attitudes of others?</p><p>Or is it firmly founded on Jesus Christ, rooted, and built up in him regardless of life's changing circumstances?</p><p>The Book of Mormon tells of people who were strict in observing the ordinances of God, but then a skeptic named Korihor came along, mocking the serious gospel calling it the foolish and silly traditions of their fathers.</p><p>Korihor led away the hearts of many, causing them to lift up their heads in their wickedness.</p><p>But others, he could not.</p><p>Because to them, the gospel of Jesus Christ was much more than a tradition.</p><p>Faith is strong when it has deep roots and a personal experience.</p><p>Personal commitment to Jesus Christ, independent of what our traditions are or what others may say or do.</p><p>Our testimony will be tested and tried. It is not faith if it is never tested.</p><p>Faith is not strong if it is never opposed.</p><p>So don't despair if you have trials of faith or unanswered questions.</p><p>We should not expect to understand everything before we act. That is not faith.</p><p>As Alma taught, faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things.</p><p>If we wait to act until all of our questions are answered, we severely limit the good we can accomplish, and we limit the power of our faith.</p><p>Faith is beautiful because it persists even when blessings don't come as hoped for.</p><p>We can't see the future. We don't know all the answers.</p><p>But we can trust Jesus Christ as we keep moving forward and upward because he is our Savior and Redeemer.</p><p>Endure the trials and the uncertainties of life because it is firmly rooted in Christ and his doctrine.</p><p>Jesus Christ and our Father in Heaven, who sent him, together constitute the one undiverted perfectly reliable object of our trust.</p><p>Testimony is not something that you build once, and it stands forever.</p><p>It's more like a tree that you nourish constantly.</p><p>Planting the word of God in your heart is only the first step.</p><p>Once your testimony starts to grow, then the real work begins.</p><p>That's when you nourish it with great care, that it may get root, that it may grow up and bring forth fruit.</p><p>It takes great diligence, and patience with the world.</p><p>But the Lord's promises are sure. You shall reap the rewards of faith in your diligence, and patience, and long-suffering waiting for the tree to bring forth fruit unto you.</p><p>My dear brothers and sisters, my dear friends, there is a part of me that misses the old Chapel and the stained-glass windows.</p><p>But over the past 75 years, Jesus Christ has led me on a journey through life that is more thrilling than I could ever have imagined.</p><p>He has comforted me in my afflictions, helped me to recognize my weaknesses, healed my spiritual wounds, and nourished me in my moments of doubt and fear.</p><p>It is my sincere prayer and blessing to all of you that you will constantly nourish the roots of your faith in the Savior, in his doctrine, and in his church.</p><p>Of this, I testify in the sacred name of our Savior, our Redeemer, our Master, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p></div> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-svelte-h="svelte-tyn8xv"><i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i></button></div></div> </div></div> </div></div> </div><div class="accordion" id="550mdzfozn9xliszbbxg-1"><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapse-550mdzfozn9xliszbbxg-1" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapse-550mdzfozn9xliszbbxg-1"><span>Elder Takasi Wada <br> <small>The Words of Christ and the Holy Ghost Will Lead Us to the Truth</small></span> </button></h2> <div id="flush-collapse-550mdzfozn9xliszbbxg-1" class="accordion-collapse multi-collapse-550mdzfozn9xliszbbxg collapse" data-bs-parent="#550mdzfozn9xliszbbxg-1"><div class="accordion-body"><div class="d-flex flex-column gap-3"><div class="d-flex flex-row justify-content-start align-items-end gap-3"><img class="speaker-image svelte-1l0ikvw" src="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/38893b22986bba46f11169441e1fb71d62adcc48/full/!320%2C400/0/default" alt="Speaker Image Elder Takasi Wada"> <div><h2>The Words of Christ and the Holy Ghost Will Lead Us to the Truth</h2> <strong>Elder Takasi Wada</strong> <br><small>General Authority Seventy</small></div></div>        <div class="d-flex gap-3"><div><p>God is our Father in Heaven.

Help me find these importantly skipping truths in my teenage years.</p><p>Just like D5 stated in the open verse of the book of First Mumbai. I was also born acoustic parents.

I watched him praying and down for the school bomb, but it offers every morning and every night.</p><p>Even though I have no idea who he was praying to and what he was praying for, I believe, some sort of unseen power or God would be mine to say, or help us to be great in theory.</p><p>A lot of teenagers I experienced many hardships, I travel thinking that the life was unfair and had a lot so ups and downs.</p><p>Well, I got lost not having a sense of humans in my life. Life seems all bleeding because he would end when I die.</p><p>Life without knowing the plan of salvation was confusing.</p><p>Not long after I started to learn English in junior High School. Almost treated in our school, receive an appeal in the New Testament.</p><p>What we have there is began Australia of English. Our teacher told us we should study English by reading it.</p><p>I open it and redo the conscience. World in the New Testament for extremely difficult for me. And also, however the words in Japanese are equally difficult.</p><p>However, I was wrong to list the questions of the soul that have been included, just before cynical texting really advice.</p><p>About feeling lonely, lacking confidence, being confused, facing life's trials, and so on.</p><p>Icha de monades was followed by a referenceable verses and pages in the New Testament.</p><p>Especially drawn to the question for New York exhausted.</p><p>The reference would I be to open Matthew chapter 11, verse 28, to return to, which Jesus said to his disciples. Come unto me all in that labor and are heavy labor and I'll give you the rest.</p><p>Can you find you upon you? Are not being or I am weak and loving part and you shall find rest unto your soul. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</p><p>This was the first person, I remember reading the word of Jesus Christ. Though, I did not understand all the words.</p><p>He said, his Lord's coming to me death and my soul gave me hope.</p><p>The more I read his words, the more I feel like I should try the virtue of his words. I never felt like I felt that day.</p><p>I felt I was alive.

I hoped some days in the future, I would learn more about Jesus Christ.</p><p>A few years later, I met very dedicated Latter-day Saints. This was my first experience with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p><p>And as a student, a small group of kind, joyful Latter-day Saints were striving to follow Jesus Christ.</p><p>Despite my initial hesitation, I came to see their examples and feel the love of Jesus Christ.</p><p>Particularly, one sacred experience was on the day I prayed.</p><p>I learned that through prayer, we can approach God with our deepest concerns and desires.</p><p>We do this because we know He listens.</p><p>In prayer, I asked Heavenly Father to help me know who He is and my relationship with Him.</p><p>I learned that I am His beloved son, and that He knows and loves me.</p><p>He speaks to me personally, uniquely, and in ways I can understand through the Holy Ghost.</p><p>Before I had recognized this, I thought all I had to do was pray in a routine manner and dramatic changes would happen.</p><p>One day, during a missionary lesson, I stepped out of the room to take a break. I was confused about what I should do with my life.</p><p>As I was about to return to the lesson, I heard a voice.</p><p>I heard my name and instead of going back in, I stayed and listened.</p><p>They were praying for me, asking Heavenly Father to help me find clarity and purpose.</p><p>Their prayers touched my heart. I wondered why they cared about me so much.</p><p>I realized that their love for me reflected the love that Heavenly Father has for all of His children.</p><p>The plan of salvation sank deeply into my heart.</p><p>Understanding who I am and why I am here changed everything for me.</p><p>The decision to follow Jesus Christ, to be baptized, and to receive the Holy Ghost has blessed my life more than I could have imagined.</p><p>And as I continue to study the gospel and strive to live it, I find peace and joy.</p><p>Our Heavenly Father has promised that as we live by the gospel, we can have the Spirit to be with us always.</p><p>It is through the guidance of the Holy Ghost that we can know what to do in every circumstance.</p><p>Heavenly Father loves us, and because He loves us, He prepared the way for us to return to Him through His Son, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost.</p></div> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-svelte-h="svelte-tyn8xv"><i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i></button></div></div> </div></div> </div></div> </div><div class="accordion" id="550mdzfozn9xliszbbxg-2"><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapse-550mdzfozn9xliszbbxg-2" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapse-550mdzfozn9xliszbbxg-2"><span>Elder Ronald A.

Rasband</strong> <br><small>Quorum of the Twelve Apostles</small></div></div>        <div class="d-flex gap-3"><div><p>To the many testimonies of this conference. I am my Apostolic witness that. Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. Our Lord and Savior, the Redeemer of all of our father's children.</p><p>All right, here's a tone that Jesus Christ made that possible for us. If we are worthy to return to the presence of our father in Heaven and be with our families for eternity.</p><p>The savior is not absent from our mortal Journeys, for the past two days, we've heard him speak to his chosen leaders, that we might draw closer to him. Family here with his pure love and mercy.</p><p>He sustains us as we Face, the drama of Life Nephi describes, might God have been my support. He had led me through my afflictions, he had filled me with his love. That love is evident and we sustain one another.</p><p>In this work, we sustain our living prophet at General Conference and the first presidency, the Quorum of the 12 apostles, General authorities, and officers of the church.</p><p>To sustain means to hold up another person to give them our attention to be faithful to their trust to act upon their words. They speak by inspiration of the Lord.</p><p>They understand the current issues, the moral decline of society and the adversary's increasing efforts to thwart the father's plan.</p><p>In holding up our hands, we are committing our support not just for that moment. But in our daily lives.</p><p>Sustaining includes holding up our stake presidents and Bishops, Quorum and organization leaders, teachers and even camp directors in our wards and Stakes.</p><p>Closer to home. We hold up our wives and our husbands, children and parents, extended family and neighbors.</p><p>When we hold up one another, we are saying I am here for you. Not just to hold up your arms and hands when they hang down, but to comfort and strengthen you as you stand at your side.</p><p>The concept to hold up is rooted in scripture at the Waters of Mormon. The newly baptized church members committed to Bear one another's burdens that they may be light, to comfort those that stand in need of comfort and to stand as Witnesses of God at all times.</p><p>To the nephites, Jesus said hold up your light that it may shine into the world. Behold, I am the light which ye shall hold up.</p><p>We hold up the Lord's light when we hold fast to our covenants. And when we support our dear living Prophet as he speaks the words of God.</p><p>President Russell M. Nelson said when serving in the Quorum of the 12 apostles, our sustaining of prophets is a personal commitment that we will do our utmost to uphold their prophetic priorities.</p><p>To hold up the prophet is a sacred work. We do not sit quietly by, but actively defend him, follow his counsel, teach his words and pray for him.</p><p>King Benjamin in the book of Mormon said to the people, I am like yourselves subject to all manner of infirmities in body and mind yet. I have been chosen and was suffered by the hand of the Lord and have been kept and preserved by his matchless power to serve you, with all of my mind and strength, which the Lord hath granted unto me.</p><p>Likewise at age 100, President Nelson has been kept and preserved by the Lord.</p><p>President Harold B. Lee at the time, a member of the first presidency cited the example of Moses standing Atop The Hill at Rephidim.</p><p>The hands of the president of the church may grow weary. He said they may tend to droop at times because of his heavy responsibilities.</p><p>But as we hold his hands and as we labor under his Direction by his side, the gates of Hell will not Prevail against you, and against Israel.</p><p>Your safety and ours depends upon whether or not, we follow the ones whom the Lord has placed to preside over his church.</p><p>He knows whom he wants to preside over his church and he will make no mistake in that choice.</p><p>President Nelson draws upon years of serving the Lord, his maturity, wide-ranging experience, wisdom, and consistent receipt of Revelation specifically suited for our day.</p><p>Because the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is preparing the world for the day when the Earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord.</p><p>This work is empowered by a Divine announcement made 200 years ago. It consisted of only seven words: This is my beloved Son, hear him.</p><p>President Nelson has also said, there has never been a time in the history of the world when knowledge of our savior is more personally vital and relevant to every human soul.</p><p>Imagine how quickly the devastating conflicts throughout the world and those in our individual lives would be resolved if we all chose to follow Jesus Christ and his teachings.</p><p>Dear brothers and sisters. We need to do more lifting and less murmuring. More upholding, the word of the Lord, his ways and his Prophet who has said, one of our greatest challenges today is distinguishing between the truths of God and the counterfeits of Satan.</p><p>That's why the Lord warned us to pray always that we may conquer Satan and escape the hands of the Servants of Satan that do, uphold the adversary's work.</p><p>Last April, Sister Rasband and I had the honor of joining our beloved brothers and sisters for the rededication of the Manti Utah Temple.</p><p>President Nelson surprised everyone when he entered the room. Only a very few of us knew he was coming. In his presence, I immediately felt the life and the prophetic mantle he carries.</p><p>The look of Joy on the faces of the people personally seeing the prophet will stay with me forever.</p><p>In the prayer of rededication, President Nelson petitioned the Lord that his holy house would essentially hold up all who entered the temple that they may receive sacred blessings and remain worthy, and faithful to their covenants.</p><p>That this may be a house of peace, a house of comfort, and a house of personal revelation for all who enter.</p><p>Those words were the lead. You all may be lifted up by the Lord with peace, comfort and most of all with personal revelation to counter the fear, darkness and contention encompassing the world.</p><p>Before the service, we stood outside in the sun with President and Sister Nelson to view the beautiful city. President Nelson's ancestral ties to the area run deep.</p><p>His eight great-grandparents settled in the valleys surrounding the temple as did some of mine.</p><p>My great-grandfather Andrew Anderson served on the construction crew of early Pioneers who labored 11 years to complete the Manti Temple, the third in the Rocky Mountains.</p><p>As we stood with President Nelson, we had the opportunity to hold up and support the prophet of God in a celebration of the rededication of the Lord's house.</p><p>It was a day I will never forget.</p><p>We build temples to honor the Lord. President Nelson said, they are built for worship and not for show.</p><p>We make sacred covenants of Eternal significance inside these sacred walls. You are gathering Israel.</p><p>President Nelson, the prophets before him have prayed over the holy temples in their arms.</p><p>Today around the world we have 350 sacred houses of the Lord that are operating, announced or under construction.</p><p>Since 2018, President Nelson has announced 168 temples.</p><p>In our time, he has said a whole complete and perfect union of all dispensations, keys and powers are to be welded together.</p><p>For these sacred purposes, Holy temples now dot the earth.</p><p>I emphasize again that construction of these temples may not change your life. But your service in the temple surely will.</p><p>The Savior and his doctrine are the very heart of the temple. President Nelson says everything taught in the temple through instruction and through the spirit increases our understanding of Jesus Christ.</p><p>His essential ordinances bind us to him through sacred priesthood Covenants. As we keep our covenants, He endows us with his healing, strengthening power.</p><p>All who worship in the temple, President Nelson said, will have the power of God and angels having charge over them.</p><p>How much does it increase your confidence to know that as an endowed woman or a man or Temple attending youth armed with the power of God, you do not have to face life alone?</p><p>What courage does it give you to know that Angels will really help you?</p><p>Angels reaching out to hold us up is described in the scriptures when Jesus Christ knelt humbly in the Garden of Gethsemane by his suffering. He provided an infinite atonement.</p><p>There, President Nelson states, the greatest single act of love of all recorded history took place.</p><p>In Gethsemane, the Lord suffered the pain of all men that all might repent and come unto him.</p><p>Remove this cup from me, Jesus Christ asked, nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done.</p><p>And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.</p><p>We have Angels round about us today.</p><p>President Nelson has said in the temple, you will learn how to part the veil between heaven and Earth, how to ask for God's angels to attend you.</p><p>Angels bring light, God's light, to the nephite Apostles. Jesus said, behold I am the light which ye shall hold up.</p><p>As we sustain our Prophet, we testify he is called of Our Savior, who is the light of the world.</p><p>Dear President Nelson, with the members and friends of the Lord's Church throughout the world, we feel blessed to hold up your teachings, to hold up your example of christ-like living and to hold up who you are, a firm testimony of our Lord and Savior.</p><p>The Redeemer of us all. Here is my apostolic witness that Jesus Christ is the light of the world.</p><p>May we all as his disciples, hold up his light. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p></div> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-svelte-h="svelte-tyn8xv"><i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i></button></div></div> </div></div> </div></div> </div><div class="accordion" id="550mdzfozn9xliszbbxg-3"><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapse-550mdzfozn9xliszbbxg-3" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapse-550mdzfozn9xliszbbxg-3"><span>Elder Quentin L.

Cook</strong> <br><small>Quorum of the Twelve Apostles</small></div></div>        <div class="d-flex gap-3"><div><p>The original handheld device. I thought about this interesting message of all times have become. Upon further reflection, I realized any device, or even one equipped with artificial intelligence, will never be as important or significant as the spiritual guidance that comes from divine revelation.</p><p>Whether handheld or digital, the Holy Bible and the Book of Mormon, another Testament of Jesus Christ, provide spiritual guidance and teachings from Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world.</p><p>We treasure these books for their profound role in documenting God's direction to ancient prophets and people, and the guidance they provide for us, for our own personal lives.</p><p>Combined with the teachings of living prophets, these sacred scriptures provide doctrinal direction for us in today's world.</p><p>These scriptures are most powerful when they give instruction, correction, comfort, and consolation to individuals and families who seek guidance from the Lord.</p><p>The scriptures, combined with spiritual inspiration from the Holy Ghost, continue to be the primary source that facilitates the conversion of those who have broken hearts and contrite spirits, and desire to follow Jesus Christ.</p><p>The scriptures help build a foundation that can withstand the adversary's constant efforts to undermine faith. New converts have been the lifeblood of the church throughout its history.</p><p>One example is particularly precious to me. When I was a young bishop, two marvelous sister missionaries were teaching the William Edward Mussman family. The father, a very capable lawyer, was general counsel of a major corporation. His devoted wife Janet was helping the family strive to live a more Christ-like life.</p><p>Their exceptional son and daughter, both in their early twenties, were also being taught. All four had received the lessons and were attending.</p><p>The sister missionaries had emphasized reading the Book of Mormon and praying for a testimony of that sacred scripture. Remarkably, the family prayerfully read the entire Book of Mormon in a short time.</p><p>The ward missionaries, both of whom were prior ward Relief Society presidents, accompanied them to sacrament meetings. As the family was nearing baptism, they received a barrage of literature critical of the church. This was before the internet, but the material filled a large cardboard box.</p><p>The sister missionaries invited me, as a recently called 34-year-old bishop, to help answer the questions being raised. When we gathered in their living room, the large box of pamphlets critical of the church was in the middle of the room.</p><p>I prayerfully approached this assignment. During the prayer, the Spirit whispered to me, 'He already knows it is true.' This was important; the sisters believed that the rest of the family already had a testimony. They were unsure about the father.</p><p>I immediately informed him that the Spirit had prompted me that he already had a testimony. Was that true? He looked at me intently and said that the Spirit had confirmed the truth of the Book of Mormon and the church to him.</p><p>I then asked whether it would be necessary to review the pamphlets if they already had a spiritual confirmation. The father replied that it would not be necessary. The rest of the family concurred with his answer.</p><p>He said he did have a significant question. One reason they had received so much literature opposing the church was that they were members of another faith. In addition, he had made a large pledge to help build a new chapel for that faith.</p><p>He informed me that the sister missionaries had taught him about the importance of tithing, which he gratefully accepted. But he wondered if it would be wrong to also honor the pledge he had previously made.</p><p>I assured him that payment of the pledge would be both honorable and appropriate. The entire family was baptized. One year later, they were sealed as a family in the California Oakland Temple. I was privileged to be present.</p><p>The son completed law school, passed the California bar exam, and immediately served a faithful mission in Japan. I have watched over the years as succeeding generations have remained faithful to the gospel.</p><p>I was privileged to officiate at the sealing of one of the granddaughters. The conversions that are occurring in our day are equally remarkable.</p><p>Last July, Coach Andy Reid of the Kansas City Chiefs and I, along with others representing our faith and other faiths, spoke on a panel of faith at Riverside Church in New York City.</p><p>Coach Reid emphasized second chances and responding to invitations and opportunities, which is what the gospel of Jesus Christ is all about.</p><p>The next morning, with our wives, Tammy Reid and Mary, we attended sacrament meeting at the Manhattan Second Ward. It was a spiritual service.</p><p>There were many new converts in the congregation. Five recently baptized members, four men and one young man, were among the Aaronic Priesthood members passing the sacrament.</p><p>I am happy to report that a similar influx of new members is happening throughout the church. We are grateful for the noticeable increase in those who respond to sacred invitations, change their lives, and accept the opportunity to follow Jesus Christ.</p><p>They enter the covenant path through faith, repentance, baptism, and confirmation as taught in the Holy Bible and the Book of Mormon.</p><p>We cannot underestimate the significance of sacred scriptures, both in conversions and in retaining people in the gospel.</p><p>The ancient prophets described in the Book of Mormon knew about the mission of Jesus Christ and taught His gospel. The Book of Mormon helps us draw closer to God as we learn, understand, and apply its teachings.</p><p>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that a man would get nearer to God by abiding by the book's precepts than by any other book.</p><p>To know that the Book of Mormon is the word of God, we need to read, ponder, and pray about it and then act according to its precepts.</p><p>The prophet Moroni promised that God would reveal the truth of the book to us as we pray with a sincere heart, with real intent, and with faith in Christ.</p><p>Studying the Book of Mormon is essential for enduring conversion.</p><p>As we contemplate the relationship between the Bible and the Book of Mormon as handheld devices, one might ask a question. How useful and complementary do you think two books would be if the Lord declared they would be joined together and become one in thine hand?</p><p>That is what the Lord declared concerning the stick of Judah, the Bible, and the stick of Joseph, the Book of Mormon.</p><p>In many significant respects, the Book of Mormon provides fundamental doctrine that enhances and builds upon the Bible. The doctrine of the Atonement of Jesus Christ is a profound example.</p><p>The Bible provides an accurate account of the mortal ministry of Jesus Christ, including His death and resurrection.</p><p>The Book of Mormon is more explicit about the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Ancient prophets explained it in detail prior to His death.</p><p>The book of Alma, chapter 42, reflects the doctrinal significance of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. It reads, 'Mortality is a probationary time to enable man to repent and serve God.'</p><p>The fall brought temporal and spiritual death to all mankind. Redemption comes through repentance. God Himself atoned for the sins of the world. Mercy is for those who repent. All others are subject to God's justice.</p><p>Mercy comes because of the Atonement. Only the truly penitent are saved.</p><p>President Russell M. Nelson has said, 'I promise that as you prayerfully study the Book of Mormon every day, you will make better decisions every day.'</p><p>He also promises that if you daily immerse yourself in the Book of Mormon, you can be immunized against the evils of the day.</p><p>As I mentioned, I was impressed with the concept of the original handheld device, a book. However, I recognize the incredible significance of the internet in the world today.</p><p>One modern handheld device can provide the information historically contained in a major library.</p><p>We are grateful to live in such a time. I am particularly grateful that it allows sacred books and church materials to be available digitally.</p><p>The internet is a powerful tool for studying the gospel. Today, many people share scriptures with friends using technology.</p><p>The Book of Mormon app, for example, is a wonderful way to introduce friends to the Book of Mormon and can easily be shared in normal and natural ways, wherever you may be.</p><p>While the internet provides many blessings, unfortunately, like the written pamphlets critical of the church I described earlier, it has also been used to create doubt and undermine faith in precious gospel truths.</p><p>It can be part of the evils of the day that President Nelson mentioned.</p><p>The adversary and those who assist him, knowingly or unwittingly, have created on the internet the equivalent of the box full of written material critical of the church described earlier, intended to drive you away from gospel security.</p><p>The issues raised to create doubt over the years have been remarkably similar. This is especially true when we compare our day with the 1960s when I was in my youth.</p><p>The scriptures teach us to use judgment and be wise in all things. The internet can be used positively or negatively.</p><p>Long-term members and those just starting to study the gospel need to be intentional about what they do online.</p><p>Do not entertain immoral, dishonest, or unrighteous material. If you do, algorithms can lead you down a path that destroys faith and embarrasses your covenant progression.</p><p>Act positively or negatively upon it. Seek righteousness and avoid dark internet rabbit holes.</p><p>Fill your life with positive, righteous ideas. Be joyful, have fun, but avoid foolishness. There is a difference.</p><p>The 13th Article of Faith is a marvelous guide. Above all, immerse yourself regularly in the Book of Mormon, which will draw the Spirit into your life and help you discern truth from error.</p><p>Counsel for those who have in any way deviated from the covenant path is to return to the sacred scriptures, prophetic guidance, religious observance in the home, and the music of faith.</p><p>Every soul is precious to the Lord. No matter where you are on the path, the Lord needs you, and you need Him. You will always be welcome.</p><p>During my many years of church service, I have cherished the wonderful people who returned to the covenant path and then served and blessed everyone they loved or with whom they came in contact.</p><p>The sacred scriptures and living prophets are a major way our loving Heavenly Father makes His plan of happiness available to all His children.</p><p>I bear my solemn witness of the divinity of Jesus Christ and the reality of His Atonement.</p><p>In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p></div> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-svelte-h="svelte-tyn8xv"><i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i></button></div></div> </div></div> </div></div> </div><div class="accordion" id="550mdzfozn9xliszbbxg-4"><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapse-550mdzfozn9xliszbbxg-4" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapse-550mdzfozn9xliszbbxg-4"><span>Elder Ruben V.

Alliaud</strong> <br><small>General Authority Seventy</small></div></div>        <div class="d-flex gap-3"><div><p>Today, I'd like to risk one of the most joyful, glorious and powerful gospel truths that God has revealed.</p><p>At the same time, it's perhaps one for which we have been criticized and experienced opposition.</p><p>Some years ago, I came to appreciate this particular truth during a discussion about baptisms performed by almost all other Christian churches.</p><p>As long as performed with water and in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, it was explained that these baptisms were not accepted by our church.</p><p>This surprised some in the audience. I was able to dive deeper into the reason for this position with an international Church audience.</p><p>It had to do with that particular belief about the Godhead. Many Christian denominations refer to this as the Trinity.</p><p>My appreciation for this truth deepened as I understood more about our doctrine.</p><p>We believe that God, the Father, and His Son, Jesus Christ, are distinct beings with glorified bodies of flesh and bone, tangible as man's.</p><p>Every time we talk about the nature of God, in some way, we are also talking about our own nature.</p><p>This is true not only because we are made in His image but also because we are literally His children.</p><p>This truth is part of the restored gospel, revealed anew with the Restoration.</p><p>This teaching is not metaphorical. We truly believe that we are literally the children of God.</p><p>He is the Father of our spirits, and because of that, we have the potential to become like Him.</p><p>This understanding has been with us since the first vision of the Prophet Joseph Smith over 200 years ago.</p><p>During the First Vision, Joseph came to know the true nature of God and our relationship with Him.</p><p>Because of that, we know more clearly than ever that God is our Heavenly Father.</p><p>From the very beginning, we have taught that we are God's children and that He has a plan for us.</p><p>In scripture, we read God's words to Moses: 'I am the Lord Almighty. Thou art my son.'</p><p>God repeated this truth to Moses multiple times.</p><p>When Moses encountered temptation, the adversary tried to confuse him about his divine identity, but Moses stood firm.</p><p>The temptations of Christ in the wilderness are similarly instructive.</p><p>The adversary began by challenging Jesus: 'If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.'</p><p>The adversary's temptations were aimed at casting doubt on Jesus's divine identity.</p><p>Twice, the tempter prefaced his challenges with the words 'If thou be the Son of God.'</p><p>Notice that this challenge came immediately after the voice of God declared, 'This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.'</p><p>We see that every time divine identity is declared, the adversary will try to undermine it.</p><p>Imagine how different our lives would be if we truly understood who we are.</p><p>We live in a world full of confusion, where many try to diminish or obscure our divine nature.</p><p>But the gospel lifts our vision and invites us to rise to the divine potential within us.</p><p>Jesus's commandment to 'be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect,' reflects eternal possibilities.</p><p>Of course, this doesn't happen overnight.</p><p>As Elder Jeffrey R. Holland once said, 'It will take time, but the promise is sure: if you come unto Christ, you will be perfected in Him.'</p><p>This is God's work and glory, to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.</p><p>That truth reminds us of our divine origin and destination.</p><p>Through Jesus Christ's Atonement, we can achieve the divine potential within us.</p><p>Even as Jesus hung on the cross, the adversary taunted Him, saying, 'If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.'</p><p>But instead, Jesus provided a way for us to receive all the blessings of eternity.</p><p>The Apostle Paul bore witness that 'the Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God.'</p><p>And if we are children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ.</p><p>If so be that we suffer with Him, that we may also be glorified together.</p><p>In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p></div> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-svelte-h="svelte-tyn8xv"><i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i></button></div></div> </div></div> </div></div> </div><div class="accordion" id="550mdzfozn9xliszbbxg-5"><div class="accordion-item"><h2 class="accordion-header"><button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#flush-collapse-550mdzfozn9xliszbbxg-5" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="flush-collapse-550mdzfozn9xliszbbxg-5"><span>Elder I.

Olympic Games held in Atlanta, United States.</p><p>Of the final ended. The final again. Ended.</p><p>Crowds poured out of the streets of every major city and town in Nigeria.</p><p>This country, over 200 million people on this traffic, transformed into a massive celebration at three o'clock in the morning.</p><p>There was infectious joy, happiness, excitement, asking, oh eight, song and danced.</p><p>Nigeria in that moment, Nigeria was united. And every Nigerian was appointed in Nigeria.</p><p>Before the big games, this team faced numerous communities. The financial support ended. Or laundry services.</p><p>At what point do a minute away from being eliminated from competition, but the Nigerian team triumphed against all odds.</p><p>These Bible-time moments changed how they saw themselves.</p><p>With a new form of confidence and individual and team hard work and target determination. No distractions and focused on me.</p><p>These efforts won them gold.</p><p>The green team at the 1996 Olympics continues to be referenced in Nigerian sports.</p><p>They ignored the many distractions facing them of their move. They succeeded beyond what was first possible.</p><p>An experience great joy has been the rest of us from Nigeria.</p><p>In a similar way, when we ignore the distractions of the world and focus on Christ and his gospel, we are guaranteed success beyond what we have fully imagined.</p><p>We can feel great joy.</p><p>When the focus of our lives is upon Jesus Christ and his gospel, we can feel joy regardless of what is happening or not happening in our lives.</p><p>The Holy Ghost will help each of us to keep the present nursing supplications to focus our lives on Jesus Christ and his gospel.</p><p>So we can experience joy in Christ, regardless of what is happening or not happening in our lives.</p><p>Several accounts in the Book of Mormon describe those who turned their lives around by focusing on Jesus Christ and the gospel.</p><p>Alma the younger rebelled and fought against the church. His father, Alma, prayed and fasted.</p><p>An angel appeared and called Alma the younger to repentance. In that moment, Alma was struck down by the angel.</p><p>He was in darkness for three days.</p><p>In that darkness, he remembered his father's teachings that Christ would atone for the sins of the world.</p><p>He pleaded with God for mercy. Joy was the result of repentance.</p><p>Mercy and joy came to Alma because he had turned his focus on the Savior.</p><p>For parents who have children who are struggling, we sometimes wonder why a loving God doesn't help our child repent sooner.</p><p>But the Lord has placed mortal angels in his church to help us, including bishops.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, if you are fasting and praying, if you do not set a timetable or deadline for God, trust that He is stretching forth His hand.</p><p>Sooner or later, on behalf of your child, when your child chooses this path of repentance.</p><p>This is because Christ is joy. Christ is hope. Christ is the promise of good things to come.</p><p>We can experience joy in Christ.</p><p>But how do we maintain such joy even through difficult trials?</p><p>I can honestly say that even now, I have lived through seasons of difficulty and trial.</p><p>But I have experienced the objective joy of which I have tasted exceedingly great joy in the fruits of my labors.</p><p>Supporter, through trials, the joy in Christ sustained me.</p><p>Where do you find joy? You can find joy as you exercise faith in Jesus Christ by serving others.</p><p>These small labors produced great joy in Alma.</p><p>In trials and problems of every kind, as they turned their focus to Christ, He provided them with blessings.</p><p>Even when trials seemed unbearable, the Book of Mormon people focused on Jesus Christ and his gospel.</p><p>They focused their lives and found joy.</p><p>A place where they could raise their children and exercise their faith freely.</p><p>These righteous people lived good lives, but even they were tried by immorality, cruelty, and hardship.</p><p>Sometimes bad things do happen to good people.</p><p>But for these people, their trials and hardships were swallowed up in the joy of Christ.</p><p>How did the Lord help these people endure these trials?</p><p>By focusing on Christ and his gospel, they did not let their troubles define them.</p><p>They defined themselves as children of God, as disciples of Jesus Christ.</p><p>They remembered who they were in Christ and felt joy in Him.</p><p>And it came to pass that they lived in joy and peace for many years, trusting in God.</p><p>They bore each other’s burdens and trusted in Christ to bear them up.</p><p>Look at your trials and let your suffering be swallowed up in the joy of Christ.</p><p>Even when you are far from your expectations, focus on Christ.</p><p>Christ will be there for you.</p><p>Jesus Christ is our ultimate example.</p><p>For the joy that was set before Him, He endured the cross.</p><p>I lost my mother recently. It was a strong trial.

You will find answers to your most vexing questions.</p><p>You will better comprehend the plan of his gospel.</p><p>I have learned that the most crucial question we each must answer is this:</p><p>To whom or to what will I give my life?</p><p>My decision to follow Jesus Christ is the most important decision I have ever made.</p><p>During medical school, I gained a testimony of the Divinity of God the Father and his son, Jesus Christ.</p><p>Since then, our Savior has been the rock upon which I have built my life.</p><p>That choice has made all the difference. That decision has made so many other decisions easier.</p><p>That decision has given me purpose and direction. It has also helped me weather the storms of life.</p><p>Let me share two examples.</p><p>First, when my wife, Dantzel, unexpectedly passed away, I could not reach any of our children.</p><p>There I was alone, devastated, and crying out for help.</p><p>Gratefully, through his Spirit, the Lord taught me why my dear Dantzel had been taken home.</p><p>With that understanding, I was comforted. Over time, I was better able to cope with my grief.</p><p>Later, I married my beloved wife, Wendy. She was a central part of my second example.</p><p>When Wendy and I were on an assignment in a distant land, armed robbers put a gun to my head and pulled the trigger.</p><p>But their gun didn't fire.</p><p>Throughout that experience, both of our lives were threatened. Yet, Wendy and I felt an undeniable peace.</p><p>A peace which passeth all understanding.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, the Lord will comfort you too.</p><p>He will strengthen you. He will fill you with peace amidst chaos.</p><p>Please listen to this promise of Jesus Christ to you:</p><p>I will be on your right hand and on your left. My Spirit shall be in your hearts. And my angels round about you to bear you up.</p><p>There is no limit to the Savior's capacity to help you.</p><p>His incomprehensible suffering in Gethsemane and on Calvary was for you.</p><p>His infinite Atonement is for you.</p><p>I urge you to devote time each week for the rest of your life to increase your understanding of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.</p><p>My heart aches for those who are mired in sin and don't know how to get out.</p><p>I weep for those who struggle spiritually or carry heavy burdens alone because they do not understand what Jesus Christ did for them.</p><p>Jesus Christ took upon himself your sins, your pains, your heartaches, and your infirmities.</p><p>You do not have to bear them alone.</p><p>He will forgive you as you repent. He will bless you with what you need.</p><p>He will heal your wounded soul.</p><p>As you yoke yourself to him, your burdens will feel lighter.</p><p>If you will make and keep covenants to follow Jesus Christ, you will find that the painful moments of your life are temporary.</p><p>Your afflictions will be swallowed up in the joy of Christ.</p><p>It is neither too early nor too late for you to become a devout disciple of Jesus Christ.</p><p>Then you will experience fully the blessings of his Atonement.</p><p>You will also be more effective in helping to gather Israel.</p><p>My dear brothers and sisters, in the coming day, Jesus Christ will return to the Earth as the Millennial Messiah.</p><p>So today, I call upon you to rededicate your lives to Jesus Christ.</p><p>I call upon you to help gather scattered Israel and to prepare the world for the second coming of the Lord.</p><p>I call upon you to talk of Christ, testify of Christ, have faith in Christ, and rejoice in Christ.</p><p>Come unto Christ and offer your whole soul to him.</p><p>This is the secret to a life of joy.</p><p>The Best Is Yet To Come, my dear brothers and sisters, because the Savior is coming again.</p><p>The Best Is Yet To Come, because the Lord is hastening his work.</p><p>The Best Is Yet To Come, as we fully turn our hearts and our lives to Jesus Christ.</p><p>I bear my solemn witness that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</p><p>I am his disciple. I am honored to be his servant.</p><p>At his second coming, the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.</p><p>That day will be filled with joy for the righteous.</p><p>Through the power of the sacred priesthood keys I hold, I declare this truth to you and to all the world.</p><p>In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</p></div> <div><button class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" type="button" data-svelte-h="svelte-tyn8xv"><i class="bi bi-clipboard"></i></button></div></div> </div></div> </div></div> </div></div></div></main> <div id="layout-footer" class="bg-body-tertiary d-print-none svelte-ujhjs7"><div class="container pt-5"><div class="row"><div class="col"><img alt="logo" src="/assets/logo.png" class="footer-logo svelte-ujhjs7">
